    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION TO IVANHOE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Author of the Waverley Novels had hitherto proceeded in an unabated
      course of popularity, and might, in his peculiar district of literature,
      have been termed &ldquo;L'Enfant Gate&rdquo; of success. It was plain, however, that
      frequent publication must finally wear out the public favour, unless some
      mode could be devised to give an appearance of novelty to subsequent
      productions. Scottish manners, Scottish dialect, and Scottish characters
      of note, being those with which the author was most intimately, and
      familiarly acquainted, were the groundwork upon which he had hitherto
      relied for giving effect to his narrative. It was, however, obvious, that
      this kind of interest must in the end occasion a degree of sameness and
      repetition, if exclusively resorted to, and that the reader was likely at
      length to adopt the language of Edwin, in Parnell's Tale:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Reverse the spell,' he cries, 'And let it fairly now suffice. The gambol
      has been shown.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more dangerous for the fame of a professor of the fine
      arts, than to permit (if he can possibly prevent it) the character of a
      mannerist to be attached to him, or that he should be supposed capable of
      success only in a particular and limited style. The public are, in
      general, very ready to adopt the opinion, that he who has pleased them in
      one peculiar mode of composition, is, by means of that very talent,
      rendered incapable of venturing upon other subjects. The effect of this
      disinclination, on the part of the public, towards the artificers of their
      pleasures, when they attempt to enlarge their means of amusing, may be
      seen in the censures usually passed by vulgar criticism upon actors or
      artists who venture to change the character of their efforts, that, in so
      doing, they may enlarge the scale of their art.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is some justice in this opinion, as there always is in such as
      attain general currency. It may often happen on the stage, that an actor,
      by possessing in a preeminent degree the external qualities necessary to
      give effect to comedy, may be deprived of the right to aspire to tragic
      excellence; and in painting or literary composition, an artist or poet may
      be master exclusively of modes of thought, and powers of expression, which
      confine him to a single course of subjects. But much more frequently the
      same capacity which carries a man to popularity in one department will
      obtain for him success in another, and that must be more particularly the
      case in literary composition, than either in acting or painting, because
      the adventurer in that department is not impeded in his exertions by any
      peculiarity of features, or conformation of person, proper for particular
      parts, or, by any peculiar mechanical habits of using the pencil, limited
      to a particular class of subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this reasoning be correct or otherwise, the present author felt,
      that, in confining himself to subjects purely Scottish, he was not only
      likely to weary out the indulgence of his readers, but also greatly to
      limit his own power of affording them pleasure. In a highly polished
      country, where so much genius is monthly employed in catering for public
      amusement, a fresh topic, such as he had himself had the happiness to
      light upon, is the untasted spring of the desert;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men bless their stars and call it luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when men and horses, cattle, camels, and dromedaries, have poached the
      spring into mud, it becomes loathsome to those who at first drank of it
      with rapture; and he who had the merit of discovering it, if he would
      preserve his reputation with the tribe, must display his talent by a fresh
      discovery of untasted fountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the author, who finds himself limited to a particular class of
      subjects, endeavours to sustain his reputation by striving to add a
      novelty of attraction to themes of the same character which have been
      formerly successful under his management, there are manifest reasons why,
      after a certain point, he is likely to fail. If the mine be not wrought
      out, the strength and capacity of the miner become necessarily exhausted.
      If he closely imitates the narratives which he has before rendered
      successful, he is doomed to &ldquo;wonder that they please no more.&rdquo; If he
      struggles to take a different view of the same class of subjects, he
      speedily discovers that what is obvious, graceful, and natural, has been
      exhausted; and, in order to obtain the indispensable charm of novelty, he
      is forced upon caricature, and, to avoid being trite, must become
      extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, perhaps, necessary to enumerate so many reasons why the author
      of the Scottish Novels, as they were then exclusively termed, should be
      desirous to make an experiment on a subject purely English. It was his
      purpose, at the same time, to have rendered the experiment as complete as
      possible, by bringing the intended work before the public as the effort of
      a new candidate for their favour, in order that no degree of prejudice,
      whether favourable or the reverse, might attach to it, as a new production
      of the Author of Waverley; but this intention was afterwards departed
      from, for reasons to be hereafter mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of the narrative adopted was the reign of Richard I., not only
      as abounding with characters whose very names were sure to attract general
      attention, but as affording a striking contrast betwixt the Saxons, by
      whom the soil was cultivated, and the Normans, who still reigned in it as
      conquerors, reluctant to mix with the vanquished, or acknowledge
      themselves of the same stock. The idea of this contrast was taken from the
      ingenious and unfortunate Logan's tragedy of Runnamede, in which, about
      the same period of history, the author had seen the Saxon and Norman
      barons opposed to each other on different sides of the stage. He does not
      recollect that there was any attempt to contrast the two races in their
      habits and sentiments; and indeed it was obvious, that history was
      violated by introducing the Saxons still existing as a high-minded and
      martial race of nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did, however, survive as a people, and some of the ancient Saxon
      families possessed wealth and power, although they were exceptions to the
      humble condition of the race in general. It seemed to the author, that the
      existence of the two races in the same country, the vanquished
      distinguished by their plain, homely, blunt manners, and the free spirit
      infused by their ancient institutions and laws; the victors, by the high
      spirit of military fame, personal adventure, and whatever could
      distinguish them as the Flower of Chivalry, might, intermixed with other
      characters belonging to the same time and country, interest the reader by
      the contrast, if the author should not fail on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotland, however, had been of late used so exclusively as the scene of
      what is called Historical Romance, that the preliminary letter of Mr
      Laurence Templeton became in some measure necessary. To this, as to an
      Introduction, the reader is referred, as expressing author's purpose and
      opinions in undertaking this species of composition, under the necessary
      reservation, that he is far from thinking he has attained the point at
      which he aimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to add, that there was no idea or wish to pass
      off the supposed Mr Templeton as a real person. But a kind of continuation
      of the Tales of my Landlord had been recently attempted by a stranger, and
      it was supposed this Dedicatory Epistle might pass for some imitation of
      the same kind, and thus putting enquirers upon a false scent, induce them
      to believe they had before them the work of some new candidate for their
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a considerable part of the work had been finished and printed, the
      Publishers, who pretended to discern in it a germ of popularity,
      remonstrated strenuously against its appearing as an absolutely anonymous
      production, and contended that it should have the advantage of being
      announced as by the Author of Waverley. The author did not make any
      obstinate opposition, for he began to be of opinion with Dr Wheeler, in
      Miss Edgeworth's excellent tale of &ldquo;Maneuvering,&rdquo; that &ldquo;Trick upon Trick&rdquo;
       might be too much for the patience of an indulgent public, and might be
      reasonably considered as trifling with their favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book, therefore, appeared as an avowed continuation of the Waverley
      Novels; and it would be ungrateful not to acknowledge, that it met with
      the same favourable reception as its predecessors.
    </p>

      Such annotations as may be useful to assist the reader in comprehending
      the characters of the Jew, the Templar, the Captain of the mercenaries, or
      Free Companions, as they were called, and others proper to the period, are
      added, but with a sparing hand, since sufficient information on these
      subjects is to be found in general history.

    <p>
      An incident in the tale, which had the good fortune to find favour in the
      eyes of many readers, is more directly borrowed from the stores of old
      romance. I mean the meeting of the King with Friar Tuck at the cell of
      that buxom hermit. The general tone of the story belongs to all ranks and
      all countries, which emulate each other in describing the rambles of a
      disguised sovereign, who, going in search of information or amusement,
      into the lower ranks of life, meets with adventures diverting to the
      reader or hearer, from the contrast betwixt the monarch's outward
      appearance, and his real character. The Eastern tale-teller has for his
      theme the disguised expeditions of Haroun Alraschid with his faithful
      attendants, Mesrour and Giafar, through the midnight streets of Bagdad;
      and Scottish tradition dwells upon the similar exploits of James V.,
      distinguished during such excursions by the travelling name of the Goodman
      of Ballengeigh, as the Commander of the Faithful, when he desired to be
      incognito, was known by that of Il Bondocani. The French minstrels are not
      silent on so popular a theme. There must have been a Norman original of
      the Scottish metrical romance of Rauf Colziar, in which Charlemagne is
      introduced as the unknown guest of a charcoal-man. <a href="#linknote-2"      name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to have been the original of other poems of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In merry England there is no end of popular ballads on this theme. The
      poem of John the Reeve, or Steward, mentioned by Bishop Percy, in the
      Reliques of English Poetry, <a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"       id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a> is said to have turned on such an
      incident; and we have besides, the King and the Tanner of Tamworth, the
      King and the Miller of Mansfield, and others on the same topic. But the
      peculiar tale of this nature to which the author of Ivanhoe has to
      acknowledge an obligation, is more ancient by two centuries than any of
      these last mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was first communicated to the public in that curious record of ancient
      literature, which has been accumulated by the combined exertions of Sir
      Egerton Brydges. and Mr Hazlewood, in the periodical work entitled the
      British Bibliographer. From thence it has been transferred by the Reverend
      Charles Henry Hartsborne, M.A., editor of a very curious volume, entitled
      &ldquo;Ancient Metrical Tales, printed chiefly from original sources, 1829.&rdquo; Mr
      Hartshorne gives no other authority for the present fragment, except the
      article in the Bibliographer, where it is entitled the Kyng and the
      Hermite. A short abstract of its contents will show its similarity to the
      meeting of King Richard and Friar Tuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward (we are not told which among the monarchs of that name, but,
      from his temper and habits, we may suppose Edward IV.) sets forth with his
      court to a gallant hunting-match in Sherwood Forest, in which, as is not
      unusual for princes in romance, he falls in with a deer of extraordinary
      size and swiftness, and pursues it closely, till he has outstripped his
      whole retinue, tired out hounds and horse, and finds himself alone under
      the gloom of an extensive forest, upon which night is descending. Under
      the apprehensions natural to a situation so uncomfortable, the king
      recollects that he has heard how poor men, when apprehensive of a bad
      nights lodging, pray to Saint Julian, who, in the Romish calendar, stands
      Quarter-Master-General to all forlorn travellers that render him due
      homage. Edward puts up his orisons accordingly, and by the guidance,
      doubtless, of the good Saint, reaches a small path, conducting him to a
      chapel in the forest, having a hermit's cell in its close vicinity. The
      King hears the reverend man, with a companion of his solitude, telling his
      beads within, and meekly requests of him quarters for the night. &ldquo;I have
      no accommodation for such a lord as ye be,&rdquo; said the Hermit. &ldquo;I live here
      in the wilderness upon roots and rinds, and may not receive into my
      dwelling even the poorest wretch that lives, unless it were to save his
      life.&rdquo; The King enquires the way to the next town, and, understanding it
      is by a road which he cannot find without difficulty, even if he had
      daylight to befriend him, he declares, that with or without the Hermit's
      consent, he is determined to be his guest that night. He is admitted
      accordingly, not without a hint from the Recluse, that were he himself out
      of his priestly weeds, he would care little for his threats of using
      violence, and that he gives way to him not out of intimidation, but simply
      to avoid scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King is admitted into the cell&mdash;two bundles of straw are shaken
      down for his accommodation, and he comforts himself that he is now under
      shelter, and that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;A night will soon be gone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Other wants, however, arise. The guest becomes clamorous for supper,
      observing,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For certainly, as I you say,
     I ne had never so sorry a day,
     That I ne had a merry night.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But this indication of his taste for good cheer, joined to the
      annunciation of his being a follower of the Court, who had lost himself at
      the great hunting-match, cannot induce the niggard Hermit to produce
      better fare than bread and cheese, for which his guest showed little
      appetite; and &ldquo;thin drink,&rdquo; which was even less acceptable. At length the
      King presses his host on a point to which he had more than once alluded,
      without obtaining a satisfactory reply:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Then said the King, 'by God's grace,
     Thou wert in a merry place,
     To shoot should thou here
     When the foresters go to rest,
     Sometyme thou might have of the best,
     All of the wild deer;
     I wold hold it for no scathe,
     Though thou hadst bow and arrows baith,
     Althoff thou best a Frere.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Hermit, in return, expresses his apprehension that his guest means to
      drag him into some confession of offence against the forest laws, which,
      being betrayed to the King, might cost him his life. Edward answers by
      fresh assurances of secrecy, and again urges on him the necessity of
      procuring some venison. The Hermit replies, by once more insisting on the
      duties incumbent upon him as a churchman, and continues to affirm himself
      free from all such breaches of order:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Many day I have here been,
     And flesh-meat I eat never,
     But milk of the kye;
     Warm thee well, and go to sleep,
     And I will lap thee with my cope,
     Softly to lye.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It would seem that the manuscript is here imperfect, for we do not find
      the reasons which finally induce the curtal Friar to amend the King's
      cheer. But acknowledging his guest to be such a &ldquo;good fellow&rdquo; as has
      seldom graced his board, the holy man at length produces the best his cell
      affords. Two candles are placed on a table, white bread and baked pasties
      are displayed by the light, besides choice of venison, both salt and
      fresh, from which they select collops. &ldquo;I might have eaten my bread dry,&rdquo;
       said the King, &ldquo;had I not pressed thee on the score of archery, but now
      have I dined like a prince&mdash;if we had but drink enow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This too is afforded by the hospitable anchorite, who dispatches an
      assistant to fetch a pot of four gallons from a secret corner near his
      bed, and the whole three set in to serious drinking. This amusement is
      superintended by the Friar, according to the recurrence of certain fustian
      words, to be repeated by every compotator in turn before he drank&mdash;a
      species of High Jinks, as it were, by which they regulated their
      potations, as toasts were given in latter times. The one toper says &ldquo;fusty
      bandias&rdquo;, to which the other is obliged to reply, &ldquo;strike pantnere&rdquo;, and
      the Friar passes many jests on the King's want of memory, who sometimes
      forgets the words of action. The night is spent in this jolly pastime.
      Before his departure in the morning, the King invites his reverend host to
      Court, promises, at least, to requite his hospitality, and expresses
      himself much pleased with his entertainment. The jolly Hermit at length
      agrees to venture thither, and to enquire for Jack Fletcher, which is the
      name assumed by the King. After the Hermit has shown Edward some feats of
      archery, the joyous pair separate. The King rides home, and rejoins his
      retinue. As the romance is imperfect, we are not acquainted how the
      discovery takes place; but it is probably much in the same manner as in
      other narratives turning on the same subject, where the host, apprehensive
      of death for having trespassed on the respect due to his Sovereign, while
      incognito, is agreeably surprised by receiving honours and reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mr Hartshorne's collection, there is a romance on the same foundation,
      called King Edward and the Shepherd, <a href="#linknote-4"      name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      which, considered as illustrating manners, is still more curious than the
      King and the Hermit; but it is foreign to the present purpose. The reader
      has here the original legend from which the incident in the romance is
      derived; and the identifying the irregular Eremite with the Friar Tuck of
      Robin Hood's story, was an obvious expedient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Ivanhoe was suggested by an old rhyme. All novelists have had
      occasion at some time or other to wish with Falstaff, that they knew where
      a commodity of good names was to be had. On such an occasion the author
      chanced to call to memory a rhyme recording three names of the manors
      forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for striking the
      Black Prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled at tennis:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Tring, Wing, and Ivanhoe,
     For striking of a blow,
     Hampden did forego,
     And glad he could escape so.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The word suited the author's purpose in two material respects,&mdash;for,
      first, it had an ancient English sound; and secondly, it conveyed no
      indication whatever of the nature of the story. He presumes to hold this
      last quality to be of no small importance. What is called a taking title,
      serves the direct interest of the bookseller or publisher, who by this
      means sometimes sells an edition while it is yet passing the press. But if
      the author permits an over degree of attention to be drawn to his work ere
      it has appeared, he places himself in the embarrassing condition of having
      excited a degree of expectation which, if he proves unable to satisfy, is
      an error fatal to his literary reputation. Besides, when we meet such a
      title as the Gunpowder Plot, or any other connected with general history,
      each reader, before he has seen the book, has formed to himself some
      particular idea of the sort of manner in which the story is to be
      conducted, and the nature of the amusement which he is to derive from it.
      In this he is probably disappointed, and in that case may be naturally
      disposed to visit upon the author or the work, the unpleasant feelings
      thus excited. In such a case the literary adventurer is censured, not for
      having missed the mark at which he himself aimed, but for not having shot
      off his shaft in a direction he never thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the footing of unreserved communication which the Author has
      established with the reader, he may here add the trifling circumstance,
      that a roll of Norman warriors, occurring in the Auchinleck Manuscript,
      gave him the formidable name of Front-de-Boeuf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivanhoe was highly successful upon its appearance, and may be said to have
      procured for its author the freedom of the Rules, since he has ever since
      been permitted to exercise his powers of fictitious composition in
      England, as well as Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character of the fair Jewess found so much favour in the eyes of some
      fair readers, that the writer was censured, because, when arranging the
      fates of the characters of the drama, he had not assigned the hand of
      Wilfred to Rebecca, rather than the less interesting Rowena. But, not to
      mention that the prejudices of the age rendered such an union almost
      impossible, the author may, in passing, observe, that he thinks a
      character of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp, is degraded rather than
      exalted by an attempt to reward virtue with temporal prosperity. Such is
      not the recompense which Providence has deemed worthy of suffering merit,
      and it is a dangerous and fatal doctrine to teach young persons, the most
      common readers of romance, that rectitude of conduct and of principle are
      either naturally allied with, or adequately rewarded by, the gratification
      of our passions, or attainment of our wishes. In a word, if a virtuous and
      self-denied character is dismissed with temporal wealth, greatness, rank,
      or the indulgence of such a rashly formed or ill assorted passion as that
      of Rebecca for Ivanhoe, the reader will be apt to say, verily Virtue has
      had its reward. But a glance on the great picture of life will show, that
      the duties of self-denial, and the sacrifice of passion to principle, are
      seldom thus remunerated; and that the internal consciousness of their
      high-minded discharge of duty, produces on their own reflections a more
      adequate recompense, in the form of that peace which the world cannot give
      or take away.

    <p>
      THE REV. DR DRYASDUST, F.A.S.
    </p>
    <p>
      Residing in the Castle-Gate, York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much esteemed and dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to mention the various and concurring reasons
      which induce me to place your name at the head of the following work. Yet
      the chief of these reasons may perhaps be refuted by the imperfections of
      the performance. Could I have hoped to render it worthy of your patronage,
      the public would at once have seen the propriety of inscribing a work
      designed to illustrate the domestic antiquities of England, and
      particularly of our Saxon forefathers, to the learned author of the Essays
      upon the Horn of King Ulphus, and on the Lands bestowed by him upon the
      patrimony of St Peter. I am conscious, however, that the slight,
      unsatisfactory, and trivial manner, in which the result of my antiquarian
      researches has been recorded in the following pages, takes the work from
      under that class which bears the proud motto, &ldquo;Detur digniori&rdquo;. On the
      contrary, I fear I shall incur the censure of presumption in placing the
      venerable name of Dr Jonas Dryasdust at the head of a publication, which
      the more grave antiquary will perhaps class with the idle novels and
      romances of the day. I am anxious to vindicate myself from such a charge;
      for although I might trust to your friendship for an apology in your eyes,
      yet I would not willingly stand conviction in those of the public of so
      grave a crime, as my fears lead me to anticipate my being charged with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must therefore remind you, that when we first talked over together that
      class of productions, in one of which the private and family affairs of
      your learned northern friend, Mr Oldbuck of Monkbarns, were so
      unjustifiably exposed to the public, some discussion occurred between us
      concerning the cause of the popularity these works have attained in this
      idle age, which, whatever other merit they possess, must be admitted to be
      hastily written, and in violation of every rule assigned to the epopeia.
      It seemed then to be your opinion, that the charm lay entirely in the art
      with which the unknown author had availed himself, like a second
      M'Pherson, of the antiquarian stores which lay scattered around him,
      supplying his own indolence or poverty of invention, by the incidents
      which had actually taken place in his country at no distant period, by
      introducing real characters, and scarcely suppressing real names. It was
      not above sixty or seventy years, you observed, since the whole north of
      Scotland was under a state of government nearly as simple and as
      patriarchal as those of our good allies the Mohawks and Iroquois.
      Admitting that the author cannot himself be supposed to have witnessed
      those times, he must have lived, you observed, among persons who had acted
      and suffered in them; and even within these thirty years, such an infinite
      change has taken place in the manners of Scotland, that men look back upon
      the habits of society proper to their immediate ancestors, as we do on
      those of the reign of Queen Anne, or even the period of the Revolution.
      Having thus materials of every kind lying strewed around him, there was
      little, you observed, to embarrass the author, but the difficulty of
      choice. It was no wonder, therefore, that, having begun to work a mine so
      plentiful, he should have derived from his works fully more credit and
      profit than the facility of his labours merited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admitting (as I could not deny) the general truth of these conclusions, I
      cannot but think it strange that no attempt has been made to excite an
      interest for the traditions and manners of Old England, similiar to that
      which has been obtained in behalf of those of our poorer and less
      celebrated neighbours. The Kendal green, though its date is more ancient,
      ought surely to be as dear to our feelings, as the variegated tartans of
      the north. The name of Robin Hood, if duly conjured with, should raise a
      spirit as soon as that of Rob Roy; and the patriots of England deserve no
      less their renown in our modern circles, than the Bruces and Wallaces of
      Caledonia. If the scenery of the south be less romantic and sublime than
      that of the northern mountains, it must be allowed to possess in the same
      proportion superior softness and beauty; and upon the whole, we feel
      ourselves entitled to exclaim with the patriotic Syrian&mdash;&ldquo;Are not
      Pharphar and Abana, rivers of Damascus, better than all the rivers of
      Israel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Your objections to such an attempt, my dear Doctor, were, you may
      remember, two-fold. You insisted upon the advantages which the Scotsman
      possessed, from the very recent existence of that state of society in
      which his scene was to be laid. Many now alive, you remarked, well
      remembered persons who had not only seen the celebrated Roy M'Gregor, but
      had feasted, and even fought with him. All those minute circumstances
      belonging to private life and domestic character, all that gives
      verisimilitude to a narrative, and individuality to the persons
      introduced, is still known and remembered in Scotland; whereas in England,
      civilisation has been so long complete, that our ideas of our ancestors
      are only to be gleaned from musty records and chronicles, the authors of
      which seem perversely to have conspired to suppress in their narratives
      all interesting details, in order to find room for flowers of monkish
      eloquence, or trite reflections upon morals. To match an English and a
      Scottish author in the rival task of embodying and reviving the traditions
      of their respective countries, would be, you alleged, in the highest
      degree unequal and unjust. The Scottish magician, you said, was, like
      Lucan's witch, at liberty to walk over the recent field of battle, and to
      select for the subject of resuscitation by his sorceries, a body whose
      limbs had recently quivered with existence, and whose throat had but just
      uttered the last note of agony. Such a subject even the powerful Erictho
      was compelled to select, as alone capable of being reanimated even by
      &ldquo;her&rdquo; potent magic&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &mdash;&mdash;gelidas leto scrutata medullas,
     Pulmonis rigidi stantes sine vulnere fibras
     Invenit, et vocem defuncto in corpore quaerit.
</pre>
    <p>
      The English author, on the other hand, without supposing him less of a
      conjuror than the Northern Warlock, can, you observed, only have the
      liberty of selecting his subject amidst the dust of antiquity, where
      nothing was to be found but dry, sapless, mouldering, and disjointed
      bones, such as those which filled the valley of Jehoshaphat. You
      expressed, besides, your apprehension, that the unpatriotic prejudices of
      my countrymen would not allow fair play to such a work as that of which I
      endeavoured to demonstrate the probable success. And this, you said, was
      not entirely owing to the more general prejudice in favour of that which
      is foreign, but that it rested partly upon improbabilities, arising out of
      the circumstances in which the English reader is placed. If you describe
      to him a set of wild manners, and a state of primitive society existing in
      the Highlands of Scotland, he is much disposed to acquiesce in the truth
      of what is asserted. And reason good. If he be of the ordinary class of
      readers, he has either never seen those remote districts at all, or he has
      wandered through those desolate regions in the course of a summer tour,
      eating bad dinners, sleeping on truckle beds, stalking from desolation to
      desolation, and fully prepared to believe the strangest things that could
      be told him of a people, wild and extravagant enough to be attached to
      scenery so extraordinary. But the same worthy person, when placed in his
      own snug parlour, and surrounded by all the comforts of an Englishman's
      fireside, is not half so much disposed to believe that his own ancestors
      led a very different life from himself; that the shattered tower, which
      now forms a vista from his window, once held a baron who would have hung
      him up at his own door without any form of trial; that the hinds, by whom
      his little pet-farm is managed, a few centuries ago would have been his
      slaves; and that the complete influence of feudal tyranny once extended
      over the neighbouring village, where the attorney is now a man of more
      importance than the lord of the manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I own the force of these objections, I must confess, at the same
      time, that they do not appear to me to be altogether insurmountable. The
      scantiness of materials is indeed a formidable difficulty; but no one
      knows better than Dr Dryasdust, that to those deeply read in antiquity,
      hints concerning the private life of our ancestors lie scattered through
      the pages of our various historians, bearing, indeed, a slender proportion
      to the other matters of which they treat, but still, when collected
      together, sufficient to throw considerable light upon the &ldquo;vie prive&rdquo; of
      our forefathers; indeed, I am convinced, that however I myself may fail in
      the ensuing attempt, yet, with more labour in collecting, or more skill in
      using, the materials within his reach, illustrated as they have been by
      the labours of Dr Henry, of the late Mr Strutt, and, above all, of Mr
      Sharon Turner, an abler hand would have been successful; and therefore I
      protest, beforehand, against any argument which may be founded on the
      failure of the present experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I have already said, that if any thing like a true
      picture of old English manners could be drawn, I would trust to the
      good-nature and good sense of my countrymen for insuring its favourable
      reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus replied, to the best of my power, to the first class of your
      objections, or at least having shown my resolution to overleap the
      barriers which your prudence has raised, I will be brief in noticing that
      which is more peculiar to myself. It seems to be your opinion, that the
      very office of an antiquary, employed in grave, and, as the vulgar will
      sometimes allege, in toilsome and minute research, must be considered as
      incapacitating him from successfully compounding a tale of this sort. But
      permit me to say, my dear Doctor, that this objection is rather formal
      than substantial. It is true, that such slight compositions might not suit
      the severer genius of our friend Mr Oldbuck. Yet Horace Walpole wrote a
      goblin tale which has thrilled through many a bosom; and George Ellis
      could transfer all the playful fascination of a humour, as delightful as
      it was uncommon, into his Abridgement of the Ancient Metrical Romances. So
      that, however I may have occasion to rue my present audacity, I have at
      least the most respectable precedents in my favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the severer antiquary may think, that, by thus intermingling fiction
      with truth, I am polluting the well of history with modern inventions, and
      impressing upon the rising generation false ideas of the age which I
      describe. I cannot but in some sense admit the force of this reasoning,
      which I yet hope to traverse by the following considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, that I neither can, nor do pretend, to the observation of
      complete accuracy, even in matters of outward costume, much less in the
      more important points of language and manners. But the same motive which
      prevents my writing the dialogue of the piece in Anglo-Saxon or in
      Norman-French, and which prohibits my sending forth to the public this
      essay printed with the types of Caxton or Wynken de Worde, prevents my
      attempting to confine myself within the limits of the period in which my
      story is laid. It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that
      the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners, as
      well as the language, of the age we live in. No fascination has ever been
      attached to Oriental literature, equal to that produced by Mr Galland's
      first translation of the Arabian Tales; in which, retaining on the one
      hand the splendour of Eastern costume, and on the other the wildness of
      Eastern fiction, he mixed these with just so much ordinary feeling and
      expression, as rendered them interesting and intelligible, while he
      abridged the long-winded narratives, curtailed the monotonous reflections,
      and rejected the endless repetitions of the Arabian original. The tales,
      therefore, though less purely Oriental than in their first concoction,
      were eminently better fitted for the European market, and obtained an
      unrivalled degree of public favour, which they certainly would never have
      gained had not the manners and style been in some degree familiarized to
      the feelings and habits of the western reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of justice, therefore, to the multitudes who will, I trust,
      devour this book with avidity, I have so far explained our ancient manners
      in modern language, and so far detailed the characters and sentiments of
      my persons, that the modern reader will not find himself, I should hope,
      much trammelled by the repulsive dryness of mere antiquity. In this, I
      respectfully contend, I have in no respect exceeded the fair license due
      to the author of a fictitious composition. The late ingenious Mr Strutt,
      in his romance of Queen-Hoo-Hall, <a href="#linknote-5"      name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a> acted upon
      another principle; and in distinguishing between what was ancient and
      modern, forgot, as it appears to me, that extensive neutral ground, the
      large proportion, that is, of manners and sentiments which are common to
      us and to our ancestors, having been handed down unaltered from them to
      us, or which, arising out of the principles of our common nature, must
      have existed alike in either state of society. In this manner, a man of
      talent, and of great antiquarian erudition, limited the popularity of his
      work, by excluding from it every thing which was not sufficiently obsolete
      to be altogether forgotten and unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The license which I would here vindicate, is so necessary to the execution
      of my plan, that I will crave your patience while I illustrate my argument
      a little farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who first opens Chaucer, or any other ancient poet, is so much struck
      with the obsolete spelling, multiplied consonants, and antiquated
      appearance of the language, that he is apt to lay the work down in
      despair, as encrusted too deep with the rust of antiquity, to permit his
      judging of its merits or tasting its beauties. But if some intelligent and
      accomplished friend points out to him, that the difficulties by which he
      is startled are more in appearance than reality, if, by reading aloud to
      him, or by reducing the ordinary words to the modern orthography, he
      satisfies his proselyte that only about one-tenth part of the words
      employed are in fact obsolete, the novice may be easily persuaded to
      approach the &ldquo;well of English undefiled,&rdquo; with the certainty that a
      slender degree of patience will enable him to to enjoy both the humour and
      the pathos with which old Geoffrey delighted the age of Cressy and of
      Poictiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To pursue this a little farther. If our neophyte, strong in the new-born
      love of antiquity, were to undertake to imitate what he had learnt to
      admire, it must be allowed he would act very injudiciously, if he were to
      select from the Glossary the obsolete words which it contains, and employ
      those exclusively of all phrases and vocables retained in modern days.
      This was the error of the unfortunate Chatterton. In order to give his
      language the appearance of antiquity, he rejected every word that was
      modern, and produced a dialect entirely different from any that had ever
      been spoken in Great Britain. He who would imitate an ancient language
      with success, must attend rather to its grammatical character, turn of
      expression, and mode of arrangement, than labour to collect extraordinary
      and antiquated terms, which, as I have already averred, do not in ancient
      authors approach the number of words still in use, though perhaps somewhat
      altered in sense and spelling, in the proportion of one to ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I have applied to language, is still more justly applicable to
      sentiments and manners. The passions, the sources from which these must
      spring in all their modifications, are generally the same in all ranks and
      conditions, all countries and ages; and it follows, as a matter of course,
      that the opinions, habits of thinking, and actions, however influenced by
      the peculiar state of society, must still, upon the whole, bear a strong
      resemblance to each other. Our ancestors were not more distinct from us,
      surely, than Jews are from Christians; they had &ldquo;eyes, hands, organs,
      dimensions, senses, affections, passions;&rdquo; were &ldquo;fed with the same food,
      hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, warmed and
      cooled by the same winter and summer,&rdquo; as ourselves. The tenor, therefore,
      of their affections and feelings, must have borne the same general
      proportion to our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows, therefore, that of the materials which an author has to use in
      a romance, or fictitious composition, such as I have ventured to attempt,
      he will find that a great proportion, both of language and manners, is as
      proper to the present time as to those in which he has laid his time of
      action. The freedom of choice which this allows him, is therefore much
      greater, and the difficulty of his task much more diminished, than at
      first appears. To take an illustration from a sister art, the antiquarian
      details may be said to represent the peculiar features of a landscape
      under delineation of the pencil. His feudal tower must arise in due
      majesty; the figures which he introduces must have the costume and
      character of their age; the piece must represent the peculiar features of
      the scene which he has chosen for his subject, with all its appropriate
      elevation of rock, or precipitate descent of cataract. His general
      colouring, too, must be copied from Nature: The sky must be clouded or
      serene, according to the climate, and the general tints must be those
      which prevail in a natural landscape. So far the painter is bound down by
      the rules of his art, to a precise imitation of the features of Nature;
      but it is not required that he should descend to copy all her more minute
      features, or represent with absolute exactness the very herbs, flowers,
      and trees, with which the spot is decorated. These, as well as all the
      more minute points of light and shadow, are attributes proper to scenery
      in general, natural to each situation, and subject to the artist's
      disposal, as his taste or pleasure may dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, that this license is confined in either case within legitimate
      bounds. The painter must introduce no ornament inconsistent with the
      climate or country of his landscape; he must not plant cypress trees upon
      Inch-Merrin, or Scottish firs among the ruins of Persepolis; and the
      author lies under a corresponding restraint. However far he may venture in
      a more full detail of passions and feelings, than is to be found in the
      ancient compositions which he imitates, he must introduce nothing
      inconsistent with the manners of the age; his knights, squires, grooms,
      and yeomen, may be more fully drawn than in the hard, dry delineations of
      an ancient illuminated manuscript, but the character and costume of the
      age must remain inviolate; they must be the same figures, drawn by a
      better pencil, or, to speak more modestly, executed in an age when the
      principles of art were better understood. His language must not be
      exclusively obsolete and unintelligible; but he should admit, if possible,
      no word or turn of phraseology betraying an origin directly modern. It is
      one thing to make use of the language and sentiments which are common to
      ourselves and our forefathers, and it is another to invest them with the
      sentiments and dialect exclusively proper to their descendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, my dear friend, I have found the most difficult part of my task;
      and, to speak frankly, I hardly expect to satisfy your less partial
      judgment, and more extensive knowledge of such subjects, since I have
      hardly been able to please my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am conscious that I shall be found still more faulty in the tone of
      keeping and costume, by those who may be disposed rigidly to examine my
      Tale, with reference to the manners of the exact period in which my actors
      flourished: It may be, that I have introduced little which can positively
      be termed modern; but, on the other hand, it is extremely probable that I
      may have confused the manners of two or three centuries, and introduced,
      during the reign of Richard the First, circumstances appropriated to a
      period either considerably earlier, or a good deal later than that era. It
      is my comfort, that errors of this kind will escape the general class of
      readers, and that I may share in the ill-deserved applause of those
      architects, who, in their modern Gothic, do not hesitate to introduce,
      without rule or method, ornaments proper to different styles and to
      different periods of the art. Those whose extensive researches have given
      them the means of judging my backslidings with more severity, will
      probably be lenient in proportion to their knowledge of the difficulty of
      my task. My honest and neglected friend, Ingulphus, has furnished me with
      many a valuable hint; but the light afforded by the Monk of Croydon, and
      Geoffrey de Vinsauff, is dimmed by such a conglomeration of uninteresting
      and unintelligible matter, that we gladly fly for relief to the delightful
      pages of the gallant Froissart, although he flourished at a period so much
      more remote from the date of my history. If, therefore, my dear friend,
      you have generosity enough to pardon the presumptuous attempt, to frame
      for myself a minstrel coronet, partly out of the pearls of pure antiquity,
      and partly from the Bristol stones and paste, with which I have
      endeavoured to imitate them, I am convinced your opinion of the difficulty
      of the task will reconcile you to the imperfect manner of its execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of my materials I have but little to say. They may be chiefly found in the
      singular Anglo-Norman MS., which Sir Arthur Wardour preserves with such
      jealous care in the third drawer of his oaken cabinet, scarcely allowing
      any one to touch it, and being himself not able to read one syllable of
      its contents. I should never have got his consent, on my visit to
      Scotland, to read in those precious pages for so many hours, had I not
      promised to designate it by some emphatic mode of printing, as {The
      Wardour Manuscript}; giving it, thereby, an individuality as important as
      the Bannatyne MS., the Auchinleck MS., and any other monument of the
      patience of a Gothic scrivener. I have sent, for your private
      consideration, a list of the contents of this curious piece, which I shall
      perhaps subjoin, with your approbation, to the third volume of my Tale, in
      case the printer's devil should continue impatient for copy, when the
      whole of my narrative has been imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu, my dear friend; I have said enough to explain, if not to vindicate,
      the attempt which I have made, and which, in spite of your doubts, and my
      own incapacity, I am still willing to believe has not been altogether made
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you are now well recovered from your spring fit of the gout, and
      shall be happy if the advice of your learned physician should recommend a
      tour to these parts. Several curiosities have been lately dug up near the
      wall, as well as at the ancient station of Habitancum. Talking of the
      latter, I suppose you have long since heard the news, that a sulky
      churlish boor has destroyed the ancient statue, or rather bas-relief,
      popularly called Robin of Redesdale. It seems Robin's fame attracted more
      visitants than was consistent with the growth of the heather, upon a moor
      worth a shilling an acre. Reverend as you write yourself, be revengeful
      for once, and pray with me that he may be visited with such a fit of the
      stone, as if he had all the fragments of poor Robin in that region of his
      viscera where the disease holds its seat. Tell this not in Gath, lest the
      Scots rejoice that they have at length found a parallel instance among
      their neighbours, to that barbarous deed which demolished Arthur's Oven.
      But there is no end to lamentation, when we betake ourselves to such
      subjects. My respectful compliments attend Miss Dryasdust; I endeavoured
      to match the spectacles agreeable to her commission, during my late
      journey to London, and hope she has received them safe, and found them
      satisfactory. I send this by the blind carrier, so that probably it may be
      some time upon its journey. <a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6"       id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>

    <p>
      The last news which I hear from Edinburgh is, that the gentleman who fills
      the situation of Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, <a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
      is the best amateur draftsman in that kingdom, and that much is expected
      from his skill and zeal in delineating those specimens of national
      antiquity, which are either mouldering under the slow touch of time, or
      swept away by modern taste, with the same besom of destruction which John
      Knox used at the Reformation. Once more adieu; &ldquo;vale tandem, non immemor
      mei&rdquo;. Believe me to be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Reverend, and very dear Sir,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Thus communed these; while to their lowly dome,
     The full-fed swine return'd with evening home;
     Compell'd, reluctant, to the several sties,
     With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.
     Pope's Odyssey
</pre>
    <p>
      In that pleasant district of merry England which is watered by the river
      Don, there extended in ancient times a large forest, covering the greater
      part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between Sheffield and
      the pleasant town of Doncaster. The remains of this extensive wood are
      still to be seen at the noble seats of Wentworth, of Warncliffe Park, and
      around Rotherham. Here haunted of yore the fabulous Dragon of Wantley;
      here were fought many of the most desperate battles during the Civil Wars
      of the Roses; and here also flourished in ancient times those bands of
      gallant outlaws, whose deeds have been rendered so popular in English
      song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such being our chief scene, the date of our story refers to a period
      towards the end of the reign of Richard I., when his return from his long
      captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his
      despairing subjects, who were in the meantime subjected to every species
      of subordinate oppression. The nobles, whose power had become exorbitant
      during the reign of Stephen, and whom the prudence of Henry the Second had
      scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown, had now resumed
      their ancient license in its utmost extent; despising the feeble
      interference of the English Council of State, fortifying their castles,
      increasing the number of their dependants, reducing all around them to a
      state of vassalage, and striving by every means in their power, to place
      themselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a
      figure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of the inferior gentry, or Franklins, as they were called,
      who, by the law and spirit of the English constitution, were entitled to
      hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny, became now unusually
      precarious. If, as was most generally the case, they placed themselves
      under the protection of any of the petty kings in their vicinity, accepted
      of feudal offices in his household, or bound themselves by mutual treaties
      of alliance and protection, to support him in his enterprises, they might
      indeed purchase temporary repose; but it must be with the sacrifice of
      that independence which was so dear to every English bosom, and at the
      certain hazard of being involved as a party in whatever rash expedition
      the ambition of their protector might lead him to undertake. On the other
      hand, such and so multiplied were the means of vexation and oppression
      possessed by the great Barons, that they never wanted the pretext, and
      seldom the will, to harass and pursue, even to the very edge of
      destruction, any of their less powerful neighbours, who attempted to
      separate themselves from their authority, and to trust for their
      protection, during the dangers of the times, to their own inoffensive
      conduct, and to the laws of the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      A circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the
      nobility, and the sufferings of the inferior classes, arose from the
      consequences of the Conquest by Duke William of Normandy. Four generations
      had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the Normans and
      Anglo-Saxons, or to unite, by common language and mutual interests, two
      hostile races, one of which still felt the elation of triumph, while the
      other groaned under all the consequences of defeat. The power had been
      completely placed in the hands of the Norman nobility, by the event of the
      battle of Hastings, and it had been used, as our histories assure us, with
      no moderate hand. The whole race of Saxon princes and nobles had been
      extirpated or disinherited, with few or no exceptions; nor were the
      numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers, even as
      proprietors of the second, or of yet inferior classes. The royal policy
      had long been to weaken, by every means, legal or illegal, the strength of
      a part of the population which was justly considered as nourishing the
      most inveterate antipathy to their victor. All the monarchs of the Norman
      race had shown the most marked predilection for their Norman subjects; the
      laws of the chase, and many others equally unknown to the milder and more
      free spirit of the Saxon constitution, had been fixed upon the necks of
      the subjugated inhabitants, to add weight, as it were, to the feudal
      chains with which they were loaded. At court, and in the castles of the
      great nobles, where the pomp and state of a court was emulated,
      Norman-French was the only language employed; in courts of law, the
      pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same tongue. In short,
      French was the language of honour, of chivalry, and even of justice, while
      the far more manly and expressive Anglo-Saxon was abandoned to the use of
      rustics and hinds, who knew no other. Still, however, the necessary
      intercourse between the lords of the soil, and those oppressed inferior
      beings by whom that soil was cultivated, occasioned the gradual formation
      of a dialect, compounded betwixt the French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which
      they could render themselves mutually intelligible to each other; and from
      this necessity arose by degrees the structure of our present English
      language, in which the speech of the victors and the vanquished have been
      so happily blended together; and which has since been so richly improved
      by importations from the classical languages, and from those spoken by the
      southern nations of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state of things I have thought it necessary to premise for the
      information of the general reader, who might be apt to forget, that,
      although no great historical events, such as war or insurrection, mark the
      existence of the Anglo-Saxons as a separate people subsequent to the reign
      of William the Second; yet the great national distinctions betwixt them
      and their conquerors, the recollection of what they had formerly been, and
      to what they were now reduced, continued down to the reign of Edward the
      Third, to keep open the wounds which the Conquest had inflicted, and to
      maintain a line of separation betwixt the descendants of the victor
      Normans and the vanquished Saxons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest,
      which we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter. Hundreds of
      broad-headed, short-stemmed, wide-branched oaks, which had witnessed
      perhaps the stately march of the Roman soldiery, flung their gnarled arms
      over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward; in some places they
      were intermingled with beeches, hollies, and copsewood of various
      descriptions, so closely as totally to intercept the level beams of the
      sinking sun; in others they receded from each other, forming those long
      sweeping vistas, in the intricacy of which the eye delights to lose
      itself, while imagination considers them as the paths to yet wilder scenes
      of silvan solitude. Here the red rays of the sun shot a broken and
      discoloured light, that partially hung upon the shattered boughs and mossy
      trunks of the trees, and there they illuminated in brilliant patches the
      portions of turf to which they made their way. A considerable open space,
      in the midst of this glade, seemed formerly to have been dedicated to the
      rites of Druidical superstition; for, on the summit of a hillock, so
      regular as to seem artificial, there still remained part of a circle of
      rough unhewn stones, of large dimensions. Seven stood upright; the rest
      had been dislodged from their places, probably by the zeal of some convert
      to Christianity, and lay, some prostrate near their former site, and
      others on the side of the hill. One large stone only had found its way to
      the bottom, and in stopping the course of a small brook, which glided
      smoothly round the foot of the eminence, gave, by its opposition, a feeble
      voice of murmur to the placid and elsewhere silent streamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The human figures which completed this landscape, were in number two,
      partaking, in their dress and appearance, of that wild and rustic
      character, which belonged to the woodlands of the West-Riding of Yorkshire
      at that early period. The eldest of these men had a stern, savage, and
      wild aspect. His garment was of the simplest form imaginable, being a
      close jacket with sleeves, composed of the tanned skin of some animal, on
      which the hair had been originally left, but which had been worn off in so
      many places, that it would have been difficult to distinguish from the
      patches that remained, to what creature the fur had belonged. This
      primeval vestment reached from the throat to the knees, and served at once
      all the usual purposes of body-clothing; there was no wider opening at the
      collar, than was necessary to admit the passage of the head, from which it
      may be inferred, that it was put on by slipping it over the head and
      shoulders, in the manner of a modern shirt, or ancient hauberk. Sandals,
      bound with thongs made of boars' hide, protected the feet, and a roll of
      thin leather was twined artificially round the legs, and, ascending above
      the calf, left the knees bare, like those of a Scottish Highlander. To
      make the jacket sit yet more close to the body, it was gathered at the
      middle by a broad leathern belt, secured by a brass buckle; to one side of
      which was attached a sort of scrip, and to the other a ram's horn,
      accoutred with a mouthpiece, for the purpose of blowing. In the same belt
      was stuck one of those long, broad, sharp-pointed, and two-edged knives,
      with a buck's-horn handle, which were fabricated in the neighbourhood, and
      bore even at this early period the name of a Sheffield whittle. The man
      had no covering upon his head, which was only defended by his own thick
      hair, matted and twisted together, and scorched by the influence of the
      sun into a rusty dark-red colour, forming a contrast with the overgrown
      beard upon his cheeks, which was rather of a yellow or amber hue. One part
      of his dress only remains, but it is too remarkable to be suppressed; it
      was a brass ring, resembling a dog's collar, but without any opening, and
      soldered fast round his neck, so loose as to form no impediment to his
      breathing, yet so tight as to be incapable of being removed, excepting by
      the use of the file. On this singular gorget was engraved, in Saxon
      characters, an inscription of the following purport:&mdash;&ldquo;Gurth, the son
      of Beowulph, is the born thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beside the swine-herd, for such was Gurth's occupation, was seated, upon
      one of the fallen Druidical monuments, a person about ten years younger in
      appearance, and whose dress, though resembling his companion's in form,
      was of better materials, and of a more fantastic appearance. His jacket
      had been stained of a bright purple hue, upon which there had been some
      attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in different colours. To the jacket
      he added a short cloak, which scarcely reached half way down his thigh; it
      was of crimson cloth, though a good deal soiled, lined with bright yellow;
      and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the other, or at his
      pleasure draw it all around him, its width, contrasted with its want of
      longitude, formed a fantastic piece of drapery. He had thin silver
      bracelets upon his arms, and on his neck a collar of the same metal
      bearing the inscription, &ldquo;Wamba, the son of Witless, is the thrall of
      Cedric of Rotherwood.&rdquo; This personage had the same sort of sandals with
      his companion, but instead of the roll of leather thong, his legs were
      cased in a sort of gaiters, of which one was red and the other yellow. He
      was provided also with a cap, having around it more than one bell, about
      the size of those attached to hawks, which jingled as he turned his head
      to one side or other; and as he seldom remained a minute in the same
      posture, the sound might be considered as incessant. Around the edge of
      this cap was a stiff bandeau of leather, cut at the top into open work,
      resembling a coronet, while a prolonged bag arose from within it, and fell
      down on one shoulder like an old-fashioned nightcap, or a jelly-bag, or
      the head-gear of a modern hussar. It was to this part of the cap that the
      bells were attached; which circumstance, as well as the shape of his
      head-dress, and his own half-crazed, half-cunning expression of
      countenance, sufficiently pointed him out as belonging to the race of
      domestic clowns or jesters, maintained in the houses of the wealthy, to
      help away the tedium of those lingering hours which they were obliged to
      spend within doors. He bore, like his companion, a scrip, attached to his
      belt, but had neither horn nor knife, being probably considered as
      belonging to a class whom it is esteemed dangerous to intrust with
      edge-tools. In place of these, he was equipped with a sword of lath,
      resembling that with which Harlequin operates his wonders upon the modern
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger contrast
      than their look and demeanour. That of the serf, or bondsman, was sad and
      sullen; his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance of deep
      dejection, which might be almost construed into apathy, had not the fire
      which occasionally sparkled in his red eye manifested that there
      slumbered, under the appearance of sullen despondency, a sense of
      oppression, and a disposition to resistance. The looks of Wamba, on the
      other hand, indicated, as usual with his class, a sort of vacant
      curiosity, and fidgetty impatience of any posture of repose, together with
      the utmost self-satisfaction respecting his own situation, and the
      appearance which he made. The dialogue which they maintained between them,
      was carried on in Anglo-Saxon, which, as we said before, was universally
      spoken by the inferior classes, excepting the Norman soldiers, and the
      immediate personal dependants of the great feudal nobles. But to give
      their conversation in the original would convey but little information to
      the modern reader, for whose benefit we beg to offer the following
      translation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The curse of St Withold upon these infernal porkers!&rdquo; said the
      swine-herd, after blowing his horn obstreperously, to collect together the
      scattered herd of swine, which, answering his call with notes equally
      melodious, made, however, no haste to remove themselves from the luxurious
      banquet of beech-mast and acorns on which they had fattened, or to forsake
      the marshy banks of the rivulet, where several of them, half plunged in
      mud, lay stretched at their ease, altogether regardless of the voice of
      their keeper. &ldquo;The curse of St Withold upon them and upon me!&rdquo; said Gurth;
      &ldquo;if the two-legged wolf snap not up some of them ere nightfall, I am no
      true man. Here, Fangs! Fangs!&rdquo; he ejaculated at the top of his voice to a
      ragged wolfish-looking dog, a sort of lurcher, half mastiff, half
      greyhound, which ran limping about as if with the purpose of seconding his
      master in collecting the refractory grunters; but which, in fact, from
      misapprehension of the swine-herd's signals, ignorance of his own duty, or
      malice prepense, only drove them hither and thither, and increased the
      evil which he seemed to design to remedy. &ldquo;A devil draw the teeth of him,&rdquo;
       said Gurth, &ldquo;and the mother of mischief confound the Ranger of the forest,
      that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs, and makes them unfit for their
      trade! <a href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
      Wamba, up and help me an thou be'st a man; take a turn round the back o'
      the hill to gain the wind on them; and when thous't got the weather-gage,
      thou mayst drive them before thee as gently as so many innocent lambs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Wamba, without stirring from the spot, &ldquo;I have consulted my
      legs upon this matter, and they are altogether of opinion, that to carry
      my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of unfriendship to
      my sovereign person and royal wardrobe; wherefore, Gurth, I advise thee to
      call off Fangs, and leave the herd to their destiny, which, whether they
      meet with bands of travelling soldiers, or of outlaws, or of wandering
      pilgrims, can be little else than to be converted into Normans before
      morning, to thy no small ease and comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The swine turned Normans to my comfort!&rdquo; quoth Gurth; &ldquo;expound that to
      me, Wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind too vexed, to read
      riddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four
      legs?&rdquo; demanded Wamba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swine, fool, swine,&rdquo; said the herd, &ldquo;every fool knows that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And swine is good Saxon,&rdquo; said the Jester; &ldquo;but how call you the sow when
      she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels, like a
      traitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pork,&rdquo; answered the swine-herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad every fool knows that too,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;and pork, I
      think, is good Norman-French; and so when the brute lives, and is in the
      charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a Norman,
      and is called pork, when she is carried to the Castle-hall to feast among
      the nobles; what dost thou think of this, friend Gurth, ha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but too true doctrine, friend Wamba, however it got into thy fool's
      pate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I can tell you more,&rdquo; said Wamba, in the same tone; &ldquo;there is old
      Alderman Ox continues to hold his Saxon epithet, while he is under the
      charge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou, but becomes Beef, a fiery
      French gallant, when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are
      destined to consume him. Mynheer Calf, too, becomes Monsieur de Veau in
      the like manner; he is Saxon when he requires tendance, and takes a Norman
      name when he becomes matter of enjoyment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Dunstan,&rdquo; answered Gurth, &ldquo;thou speakest but sad truths; little is
      left to us but the air we breathe, and that appears to have been reserved
      with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to endure the
      tasks they lay upon our shoulders. The finest and the fattest is for their
      board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best and bravest supply their
      foreign masters with soldiers, and whiten distant lands with their bones,
      leaving few here who have either will or the power to protect the
      unfortunate Saxon. God's blessing on our master Cedric, he hath done the
      work of a man in standing in the gap; but Reginald Front-de-Boeuf is
      coming down to this country in person, and we shall soon see how little
      Cedric's trouble will avail him.&mdash;Here, here,&rdquo; he exclaimed again,
      raising his voice, &ldquo;So ho! so ho! well done, Fangs! thou hast them all
      before thee now, and bring'st them on bravely, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gurth,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;I know thou thinkest me a fool, or thou wouldst
      not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth. One word to Reginald
      Front-de-Boeuf, or Philip de Malvoisin, that thou hast spoken treason
      against the Norman,&mdash;and thou art but a cast-away swineherd,&mdash;thou
      wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all evil speakers
      against dignities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog, thou wouldst not betray me,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;after having led me on to
      speak so much at disadvantage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betray thee!&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;no, that were the trick of a wise
      man; a fool cannot half so well help himself&mdash;but soft, whom have we
      here?&rdquo; he said, listening to the trampling of several horses which became
      then audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind whom,&rdquo; answered Gurth, who had now got his herd before him,
      and, with the aid of Fangs, was driving them down one of the long dim
      vistas which we have endeavoured to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but I must see the riders,&rdquo; answered Wamba; &ldquo;perhaps they are come
      from Fairy-land with a message from King Oberon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A murrain take thee,&rdquo; rejoined the swine-herd; &ldquo;wilt thou talk of such
      things, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging within a
      few miles of us? Hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer rain, I
      never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds; the
      oaks, too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak with their
      great boughs as if announcing a tempest. Thou canst play the rational if
      thou wilt; credit me for once, and let us home ere the storm begins to
      rage, for the night will be fearful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal, and accompanied his
      companion, who began his journey after catching up a long quarter-staff
      which lay upon the grass beside him. This second Eumaeus strode hastily
      down the forest glade, driving before him, with the assistance of Fangs,
      the whole herd of his inharmonious charge.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,
     An outrider that loved venerie;
     A manly man, to be an Abbot able,
     Full many a daintie horse had he in stable:
     And whan he rode, men might his bridle hear
     Gingeling in a whistling wind as clear,
     And eke as loud, as doth the chapell bell,
     There as this lord was keeper of the cell.
     &mdash;Chaucer.
</pre>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion,
      the noise of the horsemen's feet continuing to approach, Wamba could not
      be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every pretence
      which occurred; now catching from the hazel a cluster of half-ripe nuts,
      and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden who crossed their
      path. The horsemen, therefore, soon overtook them on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost
      seemed to be persons of considerable importance, and the others their
      attendants. It was not difficult to ascertain the condition and character
      of one of these personages. He was obviously an ecclesiastic of high rank;
      his dress was that of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of materials much
      finer than those which the rule of that order admitted. His mantle and
      hood were of the best Flanders cloth, and fell in ample, and not
      ungraceful folds, around a handsome, though somewhat corpulent person. His
      countenance bore as little the marks of self-denial, as his habit
      indicated contempt of worldly splendour. His features might have been
      called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his eye, that
      sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary. In other
      respects, his profession and situation had taught him a ready command over
      his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into solemnity,
      although its natural expression was that of good-humoured social
      indulgence. In defiance of conventual rules, and the edicts of popes and
      councils, the sleeves of this dignitary were lined and turned up with rich
      furs, his mantle secured at the throat with a golden clasp, and the whole
      dress proper to his order as much refined upon and ornamented, as that of
      a quaker beauty of the present day, who, while she retains the garb and
      costume of her sect continues to give to its simplicity, by the choice of
      materials and the mode of disposing them, a certain air of coquettish
      attraction, savouring but too much of the vanities of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose furniture
      was highly decorated, and whose bridle, according to the fashion of the
      day, was ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he had nothing of the
      awkwardness of the convent, but displayed the easy and habitual grace of a
      well-trained horseman. Indeed, it seemed that so humble a conveyance as a
      mule, in however good case, and however well broken to a pleasant and
      accommodating amble, was only used by the gallant monk for travelling on
      the road. A lay brother, one of those who followed in the train, had, for
      his use on other occasions, one of the most handsome Spanish jennets ever
      bred at Andalusia, which merchants used at that time to import, with great
      trouble and risk, for the use of persons of wealth and distinction. The
      saddle and housings of this superb palfrey were covered by a long
      foot-cloth, which reached nearly to the ground, and on which were richly
      embroidered, mitres, crosses, and other ecclesiastical emblems. Another
      lay brother led a sumpter mule, loaded probably with his superior's
      baggage; and two monks of his own order, of inferior station, rode
      together in the rear, laughing and conversing with each other, without
      taking much notice of the other members of the cavalcade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin, strong,
      tall, and muscular; an athletic figure, which long fatigue and constant
      exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the human form,
      having reduced the whole to brawn, bones, and sinews, which had sustained
      a thousand toils, and were ready to dare a thousand more. His head was
      covered with a scarlet cap, faced with fur&mdash;of that kind which the
      French call &ldquo;mortier&rdquo;, from its resemblance to the shape of an inverted
      mortar. His countenance was therefore fully displayed, and its expression
      was calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of fear, upon strangers.
      High features, naturally strong and powerfully expressive, had been burnt
      almost into Negro blackness by constant exposure to the tropical sun, and
      might, in their ordinary state, be said to slumber after the storm of
      passion had passed away; but the projection of the veins of the forehead,
      the readiness with which the upper lip and its thick black moustaches
      quivered upon the slightest emotion, plainly intimated that the tempest
      might be again and easily awakened. His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in
      every glance a history of difficulties subdued, and dangers dared, and
      seemed to challenge opposition to his wishes, for the pleasure of sweeping
      it from his road by a determined exertion of courage and of will; a deep
      scar on his brow gave additional sternness to his countenance, and a
      sinister expression to one of his eyes, which had been slightly injured on
      the same occasion, and of which the vision, though perfect, was in a
      slight and partial degree distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in
      shape, being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, being scarlet, showed
      that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of monks. On the
      right shoulder of the mantle there was cut, in white cloth, a cross of a
      peculiar form. This upper robe concealed what at first view seemed rather
      inconsistent with its form, a shirt, namely, of linked mail, with sleeves
      and gloves of the same, curiously plaited and interwoven, as flexible to
      the body as those which are now wrought in the stocking-loom, out of less
      obdurate materials. The fore-part of his thighs, where the folds of his
      mantle permitted them to be seen, were also covered with linked mail; the
      knees and feet were defended by splints, or thin plates of steel,
      ingeniously jointed upon each other; and mail hose, reaching from the
      ankle to the knee, effectually protected the legs, and completed the
      rider's defensive armour. In his girdle he wore a long and double-edged
      dagger, which was the only offensive weapon about his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the
      road, to save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully
      accoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his head,
      having a short spike projecting from the front. On one side of the saddle
      hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving; on the
      other the rider's plumed head-piece and hood of mail, with a long
      two-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire held
      aloft his master's lance, from the extremity of which fluttered a small
      banderole, or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that
      embroidered upon his cloak. He also carried his small triangular shield,
      broad enough at the top to protect the breast, and from thence diminishing
      to a point. It was covered with a scarlet cloth, which prevented the
      device from being seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages,
      white turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments, showed them to be
      natives of some distant Eastern country. <a href="#linknote-9"      name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and
      outlandish; the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Eastern
      attendants wore silver collars round their throats, and bracelets of the
      same metal upon their swarthy arms and legs, of which the former were
      naked from the elbow, and the latter from mid-leg to ankle. Silk and
      embroidery distinguished their dresses, and marked the wealth and
      importance of their master; forming, at the same time, a striking contrast
      with the martial simplicity of his own attire. They were armed with
      crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and matched
      with Turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship. Each of them bore at
      his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four feet in length,
      having sharp steel heads, a weapon much in use among the Saracens, and of
      which the memory is yet preserved in the martial exercise called &ldquo;El
      Jerrid&rdquo;, still practised in the Eastern countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their
      riders. They were of Saracen origin, and consequently of Arabian descent;
      and their fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and easy springy
      motion, formed a marked contrast with the large-jointed, heavy horses, of
      which the race was cultivated in Flanders and in Normandy, for mounting
      the men-at-arms of the period in all the panoply of plate and mail; and
      which, placed by the side of those Eastern coursers, might have passed for
      a personification of substance and of shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the curiosity
      of Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile companion. The monk
      he instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx Abbey, well known for many
      miles around as a lover of the chase, of the banquet, and, if fame did him
      not wrong, of other worldly pleasures still more inconsistent with his
      monastic vows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the
      clergy, whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymer maintained a fair
      character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial temper,
      and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all ordinary
      delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and principal
      gentry, to several of whom he was allied by birth, being of a
      distinguished Norman family. The ladies, in particular, were not disposed
      to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed admirer of
      their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the ennui which was
      too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an ancient feudal castle.
      The Prior mingled in the sports of the field with more than due eagerness,
      and was allowed to possess the best-trained hawks, and the fleetest
      greyhounds in the North Riding; circumstances which strongly recommended
      him to the youthful gentry. With the old, he had another part to play,
      which, when needful, he could sustain with great decorum. His knowledge of
      books, however superficial, was sufficient to impress upon their ignorance
      respect for his supposed learning; and the gravity of his deportment and
      language, with the high tone which he exerted in setting forth the
      authority of the church and of the priesthood, impressed them no less with
      an opinion of his sanctity. Even the common people, the severest critics
      of the conduct of their betters, had commiseration with the follies of
      Prior Aymer. He was generous; and charity, as it is well known, covereth a
      multitude of sins, in another sense than that in which it is said to do so
      in Scripture. The revenues of the monastery, of which a large part was at
      his disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying his own very
      considerable expenses, afforded also those largesses which he bestowed
      among the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the distresses
      of the oppressed. If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase, or remained long
      at the banquet,&mdash;if Prior Aymer was seen, at the early peep of dawn,
      to enter the postern of the abbey, as he glided home from some rendezvous
      which had occupied the hours of darkness, men only shrugged up their
      shoulders, and reconciled themselves to his irregularities, by
      recollecting that the same were practised by many of his brethren who had
      no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for them. Prior Aymer,
      therefore, and his character, were well known to our Saxon serfs, who made
      their rude obeisance, and received his &ldquo;benedicite, mes filz,&rdquo; in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants, arrested
      their attention and excited their wonder, and they could scarcely attend
      to the Prior of Jorvaulx' question, when he demanded if they knew of any
      place of harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they surprised at the
      half monastic, half military appearance of the swarthy stranger, and at
      the uncouth dress and arms of his Eastern attendants. It is probable, too,
      that the language in which the benediction was conferred, and the
      information asked, sounded ungracious, though not probably unintelligible,
      in the ears of the Saxon peasants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you, my children,&rdquo; said the Prior, raising his voice, and using
      the lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Norman and Saxon races
      conversed with each other, &ldquo;if there be in this neighbourhood any good
      man, who, for the love of God, and devotion to Mother Church, will give
      two of her humblest servants, with their train, a night's hospitality and
      refreshment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong
      contrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of the humblest servants of Mother Church!&rdquo; repeated Wamba to
      himself,&mdash;but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his
      observation audible; &ldquo;I should like to see her seneschals, her chief
      butlers, and other principal domestics!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this internal commentary on the Prior's speech, he raised his eyes,
      and replied to the question which had been put.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the reverend fathers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;loved good cheer and soft lodging,
      few miles of riding would carry them to the Priory of Brinxworth, where
      their quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception; or
      if they preferred spending a penitential evening, they might turn down
      yonder wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of Copmanhurst,
      where a pious anchoret would make them sharers for the night of the
      shelter of his roof and the benefit of his prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prior shook his head at both proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine honest friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if the jangling of thy bells had not
      dizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know &ldquo;Clericus clericum non
      decimat&rdquo;; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each other's
      hospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them thus an
      opportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed
      servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied Wamba, &ldquo;that I, being but an ass, am, nevertheless,
      honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence's mule;
      notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church and her
      servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to thine insolence, fellow,&rdquo; said the armed rider, breaking in on
      his prattle with a high and stern voice, &ldquo;and tell us, if thou canst, the
      road to&mdash;How call'd you your Franklin, Prior Aymer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cedric,&rdquo; answered the Prior; &ldquo;Cedric the Saxon.&mdash;Tell me, good
      fellow, are we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road will be uneasy to find,&rdquo; answered Gurth, who broke silence for
      the first time, &ldquo;and the family of Cedric retire early to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, tell not me, fellow,&rdquo; said the military rider; &ldquo;'tis easy for them
      to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who will not
      stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Gurth, sullenly, &ldquo;if I should show the way to my
      master's house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which most are
      fain to ask as a favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dispute with me, slave!&rdquo; said the soldier; and, setting spurs to
      his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at the
      same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose of
      chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce, yet
      hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the
      interference of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion and
      the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in
      Palestine, predominating over heathen Turks and infidel Saracens; we
      islanders love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth whom
      she loveth.&mdash;Tell me, good fellow,&rdquo; said he to Wamba, and seconded
      his speech by a small piece of silver coin, &ldquo;the way to Cedric the
      Saxon's; you cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct the
      wanderer even when his character is less sanctified than ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, venerable father,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;the Saracen head of
      your right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way home&mdash;I
      am not sure I shall get there to-night myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;thou canst tell us if thou wilt. This reverend
      brother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the Saracens for
      the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights
      Templars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is but half a monk,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;he should not be wholly
      unreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they should
      be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive thy wit,&rdquo; replied the Abbot, &ldquo;on condition thou wilt show me
      the way to Cedric's mansion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; answered Wamba, &ldquo;your reverences must hold on this path till
      you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit's length remains above
      ground; then take the path to the left, for there are four which meet at
      Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverences will obtain shelter before the
      storm comes on.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      The Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to
      their horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the
      bursting of a night-storm. As their horses' hoofs died away, Gurth said to
      his companion, &ldquo;If they follow thy wise direction, the reverend fathers
      will hardly reach Rotherwood this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Jester, grinning, &ldquo;but they may reach Sheffield if they
      have good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. I am not so bad a
      woodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he
      should chase him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;it were ill that Aymer saw the Lady Rowena;
      and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as is most likely he
      would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let us hear and
      see, and say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind them,
      and who maintained the following conversation in the Norman-French
      language, usually employed by the superior classes, with the exception of
      the few who were still inclined to boast their Saxon descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?&rdquo; said the Templar
      to the Benedictine, &ldquo;and why did you prevent me from chastising it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, brother Brian,&rdquo; replied the Prior, &ldquo;touching the one of them, it
      were hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according to his
      folly; and the other churl is of that savage, fierce, intractable race,
      some of whom, as I have often told you, are still to be found among the
      descendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme pleasure it is to
      testify, by all means in their power, their aversion to their conquerors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would soon have beat him into courtesy,&rdquo; observed Brian; &ldquo;I am
      accustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are as fierce
      and intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months in my
      household, under the management of my master of the slaves, has made them
      humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. Marry, sir,
      you must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they use either with
      free will when you give them the slightest opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but,&rdquo; answered Prior Aymer, &ldquo;every land has its own manners and
      fashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no
      information respecting the road to Cedric's house, it would have been sure
      to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our way
      thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud, fierce,
      jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even of his
      neighbors, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip Malvoisin, who are no babies
      to strive with. He stands up sternly for the privileges of his race, and
      is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a renowned
      champion of the Heptarchy, that he is universally called Cedric the Saxon;
      and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom many others
      endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a share of the
      'vae victis,' or severities imposed upon the vanquished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prior Aymer,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;you are a man of gallantry, learned in
      the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters
      concerning the 'arrets' of love; but I shall expect much beauty in this
      celebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance which
      I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl as you
      have described her father Cedric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cedric is not her father,&rdquo; replied the Prior, &ldquo;and is but of remote
      relation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to, and
      is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian, however, he
      is, self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dear to him as if
      she were his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be judge; and if the
      purity of her complexion, and the majestic, yet soft expression of a mild
      blue eye, do not chase from your memory the black-tressed girls of
      Palestine, ay, or the houris of old Mahound's paradise, I am an infidel,
      and no true son of the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should your boasted beauty,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;be weighed in the balance
      and found wanting, you know our wager?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gold collar,&rdquo; answered the Prior, &ldquo;against ten butts of Chian wine;&mdash;they
      are mine as securely as if they were already in the convent vaults, under
      the key of old Dennis the cellarer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am myself to be judge,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;and am only to be
      convicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maiden so beautiful
      since Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so?&mdash;Prior, your collar
      is in danger; I will wear it over my gorget in the lists of
      Ashby-de-la-Zouche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Win it fairly,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;and wear it as ye will; I will trust
      your giving true response, on your word as a knight and as a churchman.
      Yet, brother, take my advice, and file your tongue to a little more
      courtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives and
      Eastern bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if offended,&mdash;and
      he is noway slack in taking offence,&mdash;is a man who, without respect
      to your knighthood, my high office, or the sanctity of either, would clear
      his house of us, and send us to lodge with the larks, though the hour were
      midnight. And be careful how you look on Rowena, whom he cherishes with
      the most jealous care; an he take the least alarm in that quarter we are
      but lost men. It is said he banished his only son from his family for
      lifting his eyes in the way of affection towards this beauty, who may be
      worshipped, it seems, at a distance, but is not to be approached with
      other thoughts than such as we bring to the shrine of the Blessed Virgin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have said enough,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;I will for a night
      put on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as a maiden; but as
      for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires, with
      Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against that disgrace. Doubt not that
      we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not let it come so far,&rdquo; answered the Prior; &ldquo;but here is the
      clown's sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we can hardly see
      which of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the right,&rdquo; said Brian, &ldquo;to the best of my remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his wooden
      sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his
      body with it,&rdquo; said the Templar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in all
      such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been near
      enough to hear Wamba's directions. At length Brian remarked, what had at
      first escaped him in the twilight; &ldquo;Here is some one either asleep, or
      lying dead at the foot of this cross&mdash;Hugo, stir him with the
      butt-end of thy lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good French,
      &ldquo;Whosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did but wish to ask you,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;the road to Rotherwood, the
      abode of Cedric the Saxon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself am bound thither,&rdquo; replied the stranger; &ldquo;and if I had a horse,
      I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though perfectly
      well known to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;if
      thou wilt bring us to Cedric's in safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give
      that upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to serve
      for a guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had
      recommended, for the purpose of misleading them. The path soon led deeper
      into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach to which
      was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed; but the
      stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground and the
      safest points of passage; and by dint of caution and attention, brought
      the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet seen; and,
      pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper extremity, he said
      to the Prior, &ldquo;Yonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of Cedric the Saxon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the
      strongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course of
      passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the curiosity
      to ask his guide a single question. Finding himself now at his ease and
      near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of the guide
      who and what he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the Holy
      Sepulchre,&rdquo; said the Templar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Reverend Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the Palmer, to whom the appearance
      of the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; &ldquo;but when those who are under
      oath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a distance
      from the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a peaceful peasant
      like me should decline the task which they have abandoned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the
      Prior, who again expressed his astonishment, that their guide, after such
      long absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born a native of these parts,&rdquo; answered their guide, and as he made
      the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;&mdash;a low irregular
      building, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending over a
      considerable space of ground, and which, though its size argued the
      inhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall,
      turretted, and castellated buildings in which the Norman nobility resided,
      and which had become the universal style of architecture throughout
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in that
      disturbed period, could have been so, without the risk of being plundered
      and burnt before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch, was drawn round
      the whole building, and filled with water from a neighbouring stream. A
      double stockade, or palisade, composed of pointed beams, which the
      adjacent forest supplied, defended the outer and inner bank of the trench.
      There was an entrance from the west through the outer stockade, which
      communicated by a drawbridge, with a similar opening in the interior
      defences. Some precautions had been taken to place those entrances under
      the protection of projecting angles, by which they might be flanked in
      case of need by archers or slingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain,
      which had long threatened, began now to descend with great violence.

     Then (sad relief!) from the bleak coast that hears
     The German Ocean roar, deep-blooming, strong,
     And yellow hair'd, the blue-eyed Saxon came.
     Thomson's Liberty
</pre>
    <p>
      In a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its extreme
      length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planks rough-hewn from the
      forest, and which had scarcely received any polish, stood ready prepared
      for the evening meal of Cedric the Saxon. The roof, composed of beams and
      rafters, had nothing to divide the apartment from the sky excepting the
      planking and thatch; there was a huge fireplace at either end of the hall,
      but as the chimneys were constructed in a very clumsy manner, at least as
      much of the smoke found its way into the apartment as escaped by the
      proper vent. The constant vapour which this occasioned, had polished the
      rafters and beams of the low-browed hall, by encrusting them with a black
      varnish of soot. On the sides of the apartment hung implements of war and
      of the chase, and there were at each corner folding doors, which gave
      access to other parts of the extensive building.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity of
      the Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining. The floor
      was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard substance, such
      as is often employed in flooring our modern barns. For about one quarter
      of the length of the apartment, the floor was raised by a step, and this
      space, which was called the dais, was occupied only by the principal
      members of the family, and visitors of distinction. For this purpose, a
      table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed transversely across the
      platform, from the middle of which ran the longer and lower board, at
      which the domestics and inferior persons fed, down towards the bottom of
      the hall. The whole resembled the form of the letter T, or some of those
      ancient dinner-tables, which, arranged on the same principles, may be
      still seen in the antique Colleges of Oxford or Cambridge. Massive chairs
      and settles of carved oak were placed upon the dais, and over these seats
      and the more elevated table was fastened a canopy of cloth, which served
      in some degree to protect the dignitaries who occupied that distinguished
      station from the weather, and especially from the rain, which in some
      places found its way through the ill-constructed roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended, were
      covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a carpet,
      both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or embroidery,
      executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the lower range of
      table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering; the rough plastered
      walls were left bare, and the rude earthen floor was uncarpeted; the board
      was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive benches supplied the place of
      chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated
      than the rest, for the master and mistress of the family, who presided
      over the scene of hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon title
      of honour, which signifies &ldquo;the Dividers of Bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and inlaid
      with ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar to them. One of these
      seats was at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though but in rank
      a thane, or, as the Normans called him, a Franklin, felt, at the delay of
      his evening meal, an irritable impatience, which might have become an
      alderman, whether of ancient or of modern times.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he was
      of a frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not above the middle
      stature, but broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made, like one
      accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of the chase; his face was
      broad, with large blue eyes, open and frank features, fine teeth, and a
      well formed head, altogether expressive of that sort of good-humour which
      often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper. Pride and jealousy there was
      in his eye, for his life had been spent in asserting rights which were
      constantly liable to invasion; and the prompt, fiery, and resolute
      disposition of the man, had been kept constantly upon the alert by the
      circumstances of his situation. His long yellow hair was equally divided
      on the top of his head and upon his brow, and combed down on each side to
      the length of his shoulders; it had but little tendency to grey, although
      Cedric was approaching to his sixtieth year.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs with
      what was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality to ermine, and
      formed, it is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel. This doublet
      hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sat tight to his body;
      he had breeches of the same, but they did not reach below the lower part
      of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. His feet had sandals of the same
      fashion with the peasants, but of finer materials, and secured in the
      front with golden clasps. He had bracelets of gold upon his arms, and a
      broad collar of the same precious metal around his neck. About his waist
      he wore a richly-studded belt, in which was stuck a short straight
      two-edged sword, with a sharp point, so disposed as to hang almost
      perpendicularly by his side. Behind his seat was hung a scarlet cloth
      cloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same materials richly embroidered,
      which completed the dress of the opulent landholder when he chose to go
      forth. A short boar-spear, with a broad and bright steel head, also
      reclined against the back of his chair, which served him, when he walked
      abroad, for the purposes of a staff or of a weapon, as chance might
      require.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the
      richness of their master's, and the coarse and simple attire of Gurth the
      swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon
      dignitary. Two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their
      master upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall. Other
      attendants there were of a different description; two or three large and
      shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the stag and
      wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick necks, large
      heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs, now called
      terriers, which waited with impatience the arrival of the supper; but,
      with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to their race,
      forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master, apprehensive
      probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedric's trencher, for
      the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged dependants. One
      grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an indulged favourite, had
      planted himself close by the chair of state, and occasionally ventured to
      solicit notice by putting his large hairy head upon his master's knee, or
      pushing his nose into his hand. Even he was repelled by the stern command,
      &ldquo;Down, Balder, down! I am not in the humour for foolery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of mind.
      The Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at a
      distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments,
      which had been wetted by the storm. There were as yet no tidings of Gurth
      and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from the
      forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render it probable
      that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the outlaws,
      with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence of some
      neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made him equally
      negligent of the laws of property. The matter was of consequence, for
      great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon proprietors consisted in
      numerous herds of swine, especially in forest-land, where those animals
      easily found their food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for the
      presence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, such as they were,
      served for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep
      draughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying
      it. Add to all this, Cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper
      hour was long past, a cause of irritation common to country squires, both
      in ancient and modern times. His displeasure was expressed in broken
      sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly addressed to the domestics
      who stood around; and particularly to his cupbearer, who offered him from
      time to time, as a sedative, a silver goblet filled with wine&mdash;&ldquo;Why
      tarries the Lady Rowena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is but changing her head-gear,&rdquo; replied a female attendant, with as
      much confidence as the favourite lady's-maid usually answers the master of
      a modern family; &ldquo;you would not wish her to sit down to the banquet in her
      hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be quicker in arraying
      herself than my mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the part
      of the Saxon, with the addition, &ldquo;I wish her devotion may choose fair
      weather for the next visit to St John's Kirk;&mdash;but what, in the name
      of ten devils,&rdquo; continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising his
      voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert his
      indignation without fear or control&mdash;&ldquo;what, in the name of ten
      devils, keeps Gurth so long afield? I suppose we shall have an evil
      account of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge, and
      I had destined him for something better; perchance I might even have made
      him one of my warders.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11"       id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, &ldquo;that it was scarce an hour since
      the tolling of the curfew;&rdquo; an ill-chosen apology, since it turned upon a
      topic so harsh to Saxon ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foul fiend,&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric, &ldquo;take the curfew-bell, and the
      tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who
      names it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!&rdquo; he added,
      pausing, &ldquo;ay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their
      lights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!&mdash;Ay,
      the curfew;&mdash;Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip de Malvoisin know the
      use of the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or e'er a Norman
      adventurer that fought at Hastings. I shall hear, I guess, that my
      property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry banditti,
      whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. My faithful slave is
      murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey&mdash;and Wamba&mdash;where is
      Wamba? Said not some one he had gone forth with Gurth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswald replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon fool,
      to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that serve them, and
      fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born with
      but half our wits. But I will be avenged,&rdquo; he added, starting from his
      chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his
      boar-spear; &ldquo;I will go with my complaint to the great council; I have
      friends, I have followers&mdash;man to man will I appeal the Norman to the
      lists; let him come in his plate and his mail, and all that can render
      cowardice bold; I have sent such a javelin as this through a stronger
      fence than three of their war shields!&mdash;Haply they think me old; but
      they shall find, alone and childless as I am, the blood of Hereward is in
      the veins of Cedric.&mdash;Ah, Wilfred, Wilfred!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a lower
      tone, &ldquo;couldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion, thy father had
      not been left in his age like the solitary oak that throws out its
      shattered and unprotected branches against the full sweep of the tempest!&rdquo;
       The reflection seemed to conjure into sadness his irritated feelings.
      Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat, bent his looks downward, and
      appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn,
      which was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs in
      the hall, and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other parts of
      the building. It cost some exercise of the white truncheon, well seconded
      by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine clamour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the gate, knaves!&rdquo; said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the tumult was
      so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice. &ldquo;See what
      tidings that horn tells us of&mdash;to announce, I ween, some hership <a
      href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12"><small>12</small></a>
      and robbery which has been done upon my lands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning in less than three minutes, a warder announced &ldquo;that the Prior
      Aymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, commander
      of the valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with a small
      retinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on their
      way to a tournament which was to be held not far from Ashby-de-la-Zouche,
      on the second day from the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;&mdash;muttered Cedric;
      &ldquo;Normans both;&mdash;but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality of Rotherwood
      must not be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt&mdash;more
      welcome would they have been to have ridden further on their way&mdash;But
      it were unworthy to murmur for a night's lodging and a night's food; in
      the quality of guests, at least, even Normans must suppress their
      insolence.&mdash;Go, Hundebert,&rdquo; he added, to a sort of major-domo who
      stood behind him with a white wand; &ldquo;take six of the attendants, and
      introduce the strangers to the guests' lodging. Look after their horses
      and mules, and see their train lack nothing. Let them have change of
      vestments if they require it, and fire, and water to wash, and wine and
      ale; and bid the cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal; and
      let it be put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it. Say
      to them, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is
      under a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own
      hall to meet any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty. Begone! see
      them carefully tended; let them not say in their pride, the Saxon churl
      has shown at once his poverty and his avarice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his master's
      commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prior Aymer!&rdquo; repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, &ldquo;the brother, if I
      mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord of Middleham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oswald made a respectful sign of assent. &ldquo;His brother sits in the seat,
      and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgar of
      Middleham; but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they
      say, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn
      better than bell and book: Good; let him come, he shall be welcome. How
      named ye the Templar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brian de Bois-Guilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone,
      which the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ,
      and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those around
      him&mdash;&ldquo;Bois-Guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for good and
      evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order; but stained with
      their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and voluptuousness; a
      hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth, nor awe of heaven. So
      say the few warriors who have returned from Palestine.&mdash;Well; it is
      but for one night; he shall be welcome too.&mdash;Oswald, broach the
      oldest wine-cask; place the best mead, the mightiest ale, the richest
      morat, the most sparkling cider, the most odoriferous pigments, upon the
      board; fill the largest horns <a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13"       id="linknoteref-13"><small>13</small></a> &mdash;Templars and Abbots love
      good wines and good measure.&mdash;Elgitha, let thy Lady Rowena, know we
      shall not this night expect her in the hall, unless such be her especial
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will be her especial pleasure,&rdquo; answered Elgitha, with great
      readiness, &ldquo;for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from
      Palestine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but
      Rowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from his
      anger. He only replied, &ldquo;Silence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy
      discretion. Say my message to thy mistress, and let her do her pleasure.
      Here, at least, the descendant of Alfred still reigns a princess.&rdquo; Elgitha
      left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Palestine!&rdquo; repeated the Saxon; &ldquo;Palestine! how many ears are turned to
      the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocritical pilgrims, bring from
      that fatal land! I too might ask&mdash;I too might enquire&mdash;I too
      might listen with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers
      devise to cheat us into hospitality&mdash;but no&mdash;The son who has
      disobeyed me is no longer mine; nor will I concern myself more for his
      fate than for that of the most worthless among the millions that ever
      shaped the cross on their shoulder, rushed into excess and
      blood-guiltiness, and called it an accomplishment of the will of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knit his brows, and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as he
      raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast wide,
      and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics bearing
      blazing torches, the guests of the evening entered the apartment.

</pre>
    <p>
      The Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his
      riding robe for one of yet more costly materials, over which he wore a
      cope curiously embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring, which
      marked his ecclesiastical dignity, his fingers, though contrary to the
      canon, were loaded with precious gems; his sandals were of the finest
      leather which was imported from Spain; his beard trimmed to as small
      dimensions as his order would possibly permit, and his shaven crown
      concealed by a scarlet cap richly embroidered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though less
      studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and his
      appearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had
      exchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk,
      garnished with furs, over which flowed his long robe of spotless white, in
      ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of his order was cut on the shoulder
      of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested his brows,
      which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of a raven
      blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion. Nothing could
      be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner, had they not been
      marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily acquired by the
      exercise of unresisted authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two dignified persons were followed by their respective attendants,
      and at a more humble distance by their guide, whose figure had nothing
      more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a pilgrim. A cloak
      or mantle of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole body. It was in shape
      something like the cloak of a modern hussar, having similar flaps for
      covering the arms, and was called a &ldquo;Sclaveyn&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Sclavonian&rdquo;. Coarse
      sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet; a broad and shadowy hat,
      with cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and a long staff shod with iron,
      to the upper end of which was attached a branch of palm, completed the
      palmer's attire. He followed modestly the last of the train which entered
      the hall, and, observing that the lower table scarce afforded room
      sufficient for the domestics of Cedric and the retinue of his guests, he
      withdrew to a settle placed beside and almost under one of the large
      chimneys, and seemed to employ himself in drying his garments, until the
      retreat of some one should make room at the board, or the hospitality of
      the steward should supply him with refreshments in the place he had chosen
      apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality,
      and, descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, made three
      steps towards them, and then awaited their approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grieve,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;reverend Prior, that my vow binds me to advance no
      farther upon this floor of my fathers, even to receive such guests as you,
      and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has expounded
      to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy. Let me also pray, that you
      will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that you will
      reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits; if not, I sufficiently
      understand Norman to follow your meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vows,&rdquo; said the Abbot, &ldquo;must be unloosed, worthy Franklin, or permit me
      rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title is antiquated. Vows are the
      knots which tie us to Heaven&mdash;they are the cords which bind the
      sacrifice to the horns of the altar,&mdash;and are therefore,&mdash;as I
      said before,&mdash;to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother
      Church shall pronounce the contrary. And respecting language, I willingly
      hold communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda of
      Middleham, who died in odour of sanctity, little short, if we may presume
      to say so, of her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of Whitby,
      God be gracious to her soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue, his
      companion said briefly and emphatically, &ldquo;I speak ever French, the
      language of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English
      sufficiently to communicate with the natives of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances,
      which comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call
      forth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed further
      show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his guests to
      assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close beside him,
      and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed upon the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the attendants hastened to obey Cedric's commands, his eye
      distinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion Wamba, had just
      entered the hall. &ldquo;Send these loitering knaves up hither,&rdquo; said the Saxon,
      impatiently. And when the culprits came before the dais,&mdash;&ldquo;How comes
      it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? Hast thou
      brought home thy charge, sirrah Gurth, or hast thou left them to robbers
      and marauders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The herd is safe, so please ye,&rdquo; said Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it does not please me, thou knave,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;that I should be
      made to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit here devising vengeance
      against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I tell thee,
      shackles and the prison-house shall punish the next offence of this kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth, knowing his master's irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;
      but the Jester, who could presume upon Cedric's tolerance, by virtue of
      his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; &ldquo;In troth, uncle Cedric,
      you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How, sir?&rdquo; said his master; &ldquo;you shall to the porter's lodge, and taste
      of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First let your wisdom tell me,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;is it just and reasonable to
      punish one person for the fault of another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, fool,&rdquo; answered Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog
      Fangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we had
      got our herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard the
      vesper-bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hang up Fangs,&rdquo; said Cedric, turning hastily towards the swineherd,
      &ldquo;if the fault is his, and get thee another dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under favour, uncle,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;that were still somewhat on the
      bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that he was lame
      and could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off two
      of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow had been
      consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?&rdquo; said the
      Saxon, kindling in wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, that did old Hubert,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;Sir Philip de Malvoisin's
      keeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest, and said he
      chased the deer contrary to his master's right, as warden of the walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foul fiend take Malvoisin,&rdquo; answered the Saxon, &ldquo;and his keeper both!
      I will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of the great
      Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy place&mdash;and
      thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare to touch it,
      I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head, if I strike not
      off the forefinger of his right hand!&mdash;he shall draw bowstring no
      more.&mdash;I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset here with
      neighbours that match your infidels, Sir Knight, in Holy Land. But your
      homely fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make amends for hard
      fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no apologies
      from the lord of the mansion. Swine's flesh, dressed in several modes,
      appeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of fowls, deer,
      goats, and hares, and various kinds of fish, together with huge loaves and
      cakes of bread, and sundry confections made of fruits and honey. The
      smaller sorts of wild-fowl, of which there was abundance, were not served
      up in platters, but brought in upon small wooden spits or broaches, and
      offered by the pages and domestics who bore them, to each guest in
      succession, who cut from them such a portion as he pleased. Beside each
      person of rank was placed a goblet of silver; the lower board was
      accommodated with large drinking horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward,
      suddenly raising his wand, said aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;Forbear!&mdash;Place for the
      Lady Rowena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet
      table, and Rowena, followed by four female attendants, entered the
      apartment. Cedric, though surprised, and perhaps not altogether agreeably
      so, at his ward appearing in public on this occasion, hastened to meet
      her, and to conduct her, with respectful ceremony, to the elevated seat at
      his own right hand, appropriated to the lady of the mansion. All stood up
      to receive her; and, replying to their courtesy by a mute gesture of
      salutation, she moved gracefully forward to assume her place at the board.
      Ere she had time to do so, the Templar whispered to the Prior, &ldquo;I shall
      wear no collar of gold of yours at the tournament. The Chian wine is your
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said I not so?&rdquo; answered the Prior; &ldquo;but check your raptures, the
      Franklin observes you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the immediate
      impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert kept his eyes riveted on
      the Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his imagination, because
      differing widely from those of the Eastern sultanas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature, yet
      not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior height.
      Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her head and
      features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches to fair
      beauties. Her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a graceful
      eyebrow of brown sufficiently marked to give expression to the forehead,
      seemed capable to kindle as well as melt, to command as well as to
      beseech. If mildness were the more natural expression of such a
      combination of features, it was plain, that in the present instance, the
      exercise of habitual superiority, and the reception of general homage, had
      given to the Saxon lady a loftier character, which mingled with and
      qualified that bestowed by nature. Her profuse hair, of a colour betwixt
      brown and flaxen, was arranged in a fanciful and graceful manner in
      numerous ringlets, to form which art had probably aided nature. These
      locks were braided with gems, and, being worn at full length, intimated
      the noble birth and free-born condition of the maiden. A golden chain, to
      which was attached a small reliquary of the same metal, hung round her
      neck. She wore bracelets on her arms, which were bare. Her dress was an
      under-gown and kirtle of pale sea-green silk, over which hung a long loose
      robe, which reached to the ground, having very wide sleeves, which came
      down, however, very little below the elbow. This robe was crimson, and
      manufactured out of the very finest wool. A veil of silk, interwoven with
      gold, was attached to the upper part of it, which could be, at the
      wearer's pleasure, either drawn over the face and bosom after the Spanish
      fashion, or disposed as a sort of drapery round the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rowena perceived the Knight Templar's eyes bent on her with an
      ardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under which they moved, gave
      them the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the veil around
      her face, as an intimation that the determined freedom of his glance was
      disagreeable. Cedric saw the motion and its cause. &ldquo;Sir Templar,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;the cheeks of our Saxon maidens have seen too little of the sun to enable
      them to bear the fixed glance of a crusader.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have offended,&rdquo; replied Sir Brian, &ldquo;I crave your pardon,&mdash;that
      is, I crave the Lady Rowena's pardon,&mdash;for my humility will carry me
      no lower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;has punished us all, in chastising the
      boldness of my friend. Let me hope she will be less cruel to the splendid
      train which are to meet at the tournament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our going thither,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;is uncertain. I love not these
      vanities, which were unknown to my fathers when England was free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope, nevertheless,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;our company may determine
      you to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort of Sir
      Brian de Bois-Guilbert is not to be despised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Prior,&rdquo; answered the Saxon, &ldquo;wheresoever I have travelled in this
      land, I have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my good sword
      and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. At present, if
      we indeed journey to Ashby-de-la-Zouche, we do so with my noble neighbour
      and countryman Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and with such a train as would
      set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.&mdash;I drink to you, Sir
      Prior, in this cup of wine, which I trust your taste will approve, and I
      thank you for your courtesy. Should you be so rigid in adhering to
      monastic rule,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as to prefer your acid preparation of milk, I
      hope you will not strain courtesy to do me reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Priest, laughing, &ldquo;it is only in our abbey that we confine
      ourselves to the 'lac dulce' or the 'lac acidum' either. Conversing with,
      the world, we use the world's fashions, and therefore I answer your pledge
      in this honest wine, and leave the weaker liquor to my lay-brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the Templar, filling his goblet, &ldquo;drink wassail to the fair
      Rowena; for since her namesake introduced the word into England, has never
      been one more worthy of such a tribute. By my faith, I could pardon the
      unhappy Vortigern, had he half the cause that we now witness, for making
      shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will spare your courtesy, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rowena with dignity, and
      without unveiling herself; &ldquo;or rather I will tax it so far as to require
      of you the latest news from Palestine, a theme more agreeable to our
      English ears than the compliments which your French breeding teaches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little of importance to say, lady,&rdquo; answered Sir Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;excepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with Saladin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by Wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon a
      chair, the back of which was decorated with two ass's ears, and which was
      placed about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time to time,
      supplied him with victuals from his own trencher; a favour, however, which
      the Jester shared with the favourite dogs, of whom, as we have already
      noticed, there were several in attendance. Here sat Wamba, with a small
      table before him, his heels tucked up against the bar of the chair, his
      cheeks sucked up so as to make his jaws resemble a pair of nut-crackers,
      and his eyes half-shut, yet watching with alertness every opportunity to
      exercise his licensed foolery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These truces with the infidels,&rdquo; he exclaimed, without caring how
      suddenly he interrupted the stately Templar, &ldquo;make an old man of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to, knave, how so?&rdquo; said Cedric, his features prepared to receive
      favourably the expected jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Wamba, &ldquo;I remember three of them in my day, each of
      which was to endure for the course of fifty years; so that, by
      computation, I must be at least a hundred and fifty years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will warrant you against dying of old age, however,&rdquo; said the Templar,
      who now recognised his friend of the forest; &ldquo;I will assure you from all
      deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to wayfarers, as you
      did this night to the Prior and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sirrah!&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;misdirect travellers? We must have you whipt;
      you are at least as much rogue as fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray thee, uncle,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;let my folly, for once,
      protect my roguery. I did but make a mistake between my right hand and my
      left; and he might have pardoned a greater, who took a fool for his
      counsellor and guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porter's page,
      who announced that there was a stranger at the gate, imploring admittance
      and hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;be he who or what he may;&mdash;a night like
      that which roars without, compels even wild animals to herd with tame, and
      to seek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish by the
      elements. Let his wants be ministered to with all care&mdash;look to it,
      Oswald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his patron
      obeyed.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,
  senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with
  the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the
  same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
  a Christian is?
  &mdash;Merchant of Venice
</pre>
    <p>
      Oswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, &ldquo;It is a Jew, who
      calls himself Isaac of York; is it fit I should marshall him into the
      hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Gurth do thine office, Oswald,&rdquo; said Wamba with his usual effrontery;
      &ldquo;the swineherd will be a fit usher to the Jew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St Mary,&rdquo; said the Abbot, crossing himself, &ldquo;an unbelieving Jew, and
      admitted into this presence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dog Jew,&rdquo; echoed the Templar, &ldquo;to approach a defender of the Holy
      Sepulchre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;it would seem the Templars love the Jews'
      inheritance better than they do their company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, my worthy guests,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;my hospitality must not be
      bounded by your dislikes. If Heaven bore with the whole nation of
      stiff-necked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number, we may
      endure the presence of one Jew for a few hours. But I constrain no man to
      converse or to feed with him.&mdash;Let him have a board and a morsel
      apart,&mdash;unless,&rdquo; he said smiling, &ldquo;these turban'd strangers will
      admit his society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Franklin,&rdquo; answered the Templar, &ldquo;my Saracen slaves are true Moslems,
      and scorn as much as any Christian to hold intercourse with a Jew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, in faith,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;I cannot see that the worshippers of Mahound
      and Termagaunt have so greatly the advantage over the people once chosen
      of Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall sit with thee, Wamba,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;the fool and the knave will
      be well met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fool,&rdquo; answered Wamba, raising the relics of a gammon of bacon, &ldquo;will
      take care to erect a bulwark against the knave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;for here he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Introduced with little ceremony, and advancing with fear and hesitation,
      and many a bow of deep humility, a tall thin old man, who, however, had
      lost by the habit of stooping much of his actual height, approached the
      lower end of the board. His features, keen and regular, with an aquiline
      nose, and piercing black eyes; his high and wrinkled forehead, and long
      grey hair and beard, would have been considered as handsome, had they not
      been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a race, which, during those
      dark ages, was alike detested by the credulous and prejudiced vulgar, and
      persecuted by the greedy and rapacious nobility, and who, perhaps, owing
      to that very hatred and persecution, had adopted a national character, in
      which there was much, to say the least, mean and unamiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew's dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the
      storm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering a dark purple
      tunic. He had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his waist,
      which sustained a small knife, together with a case for writing materials,
      but no weapon. He wore a high square yellow cap of a peculiar fashion,
      assigned to his nation to distinguish them from Christians, and which he
      doffed with great humility at the door of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reception of this person in the hall of Cedric the Saxon, was such as
      might have satisfied the most prejudiced enemy of the tribes of Israel.
      Cedric himself coldly nodded in answer to the Jew's repeated salutations,
      and signed to him to take place at the lower end of the table, where,
      however, no one offered to make room for him. On the contrary, as he
      passed along the file, casting a timid supplicating glance, and turning
      towards each of those who occupied the lower end of the board, the Saxon
      domestics squared their shoulders, and continued to devour their supper
      with great perseverance, paying not the least attention to the wants of
      the new guest. The attendants of the Abbot crossed themselves, with looks
      of pious horror, and the very heathen Saracens, as Isaac drew near them,
      curled up their whiskers with indignation, and laid their hands on their
      poniards, as if ready to rid themselves by the most desperate means from
      the apprehended contamination of his nearer approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably the same motives which induced Cedric to open his hall to this
      son of a rejected people, would have made him insist on his attendants
      receiving Isaac with more courtesy. But the Abbot had, at this moment,
      engaged him in a most interesting discussion on the breed and character of
      his favourite hounds, which he would not have interrupted for matters of
      much greater importance than that of a Jew going to bed supperless. While
      Isaac thus stood an outcast in the present society, like his people among
      the nations, looking in vain for welcome or resting place, the pilgrim who
      sat by the chimney took compassion upon him, and resigned his seat, saying
      briefly, &ldquo;Old man, my garments are dried, my hunger is appeased, thou art
      both wet and fasting.&rdquo; So saying, he gathered together, and brought to a
      flame, the decaying brands which lay scattered on the ample hearth; took
      from the larger board a mess of pottage and seethed kid, placed it upon
      the small table at which he had himself supped, and, without waiting the
      Jew's thanks, went to the other side of the hall;&mdash;whether from
      unwillingness to hold more close communication with the object of his
      benevolence, or from a wish to draw near to the upper end of the table,
      seemed uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had there been painters in those days capable to execute such a subject,
      the Jew, as he bent his withered form, and expanded his chilled and
      trembling hands over the fire, would have formed no bad emblematical
      personification of the Winter season. Having dispelled the cold, he turned
      eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before him, and ate with a
      haste and an apparent relish, that seemed to betoken long abstinence from
      food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Abbot and Cedric continued their discourse upon hunting; the
      Lady Rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her attendant
      females; and the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered from the Jew to the
      Saxon beauty, revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to
      interest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I marvel, worthy Cedric,&rdquo; said the Abbot, as their discourse proceeded,
      &ldquo;that, great as your predilection is for your own manly language, you do
      not receive the Norman-French into your favour, so far at least as the
      mystery of wood-craft and hunting is concerned. Surely no tongue is so
      rich in the various phrases which the field-sports demand, or furnishes
      means to the experienced woodman so well to express his jovial art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Father Aymer,&rdquo; said the Saxon, &ldquo;be it known to you, I care not for
      those over-sea refinements, without which I can well enough take my
      pleasure in the woods. I can wind my horn, though I call not the blast
      either a 'recheate' or a 'morte'&mdash;I can cheer my dogs on the prey,
      and I can flay and quarter the animal when it is brought down, without
      using the newfangled jargon of 'curee, arbor, nombles', and all the babble
      of the fabulous Sir Tristrem.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14"       id="linknoteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The French,&rdquo; said the Templar, raising his voice with the presumptuous
      and authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions, &ldquo;is not only the
      natural language of the chase, but that of love and of war, in which
      ladies should be won and enemies defied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pledge me in a cup of wine, Sir Templar,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;and fill another
      to the Abbot, while I look back some thirty years to tell you another
      tale. As Cedric the Saxon then was, his plain English tale needed no
      garnish from French troubadours, when it was told in the ear of beauty;
      and the field of Northallerton, upon the day of the Holy Standard, could
      tell whether the Saxon war-cry was not heard as far within the ranks of
      the Scottish host as the 'cri de guerre' of the boldest Norman baron. To
      the memory of the brave who fought there!&mdash;Pledge me, my guests.&rdquo; He
      drank deep, and went on with increasing warmth. &ldquo;Ay, that was a day of
      cleaving of shields, when a hundred banners were bent forwards over the
      heads of the valiant, and blood flowed round like water, and death was
      held better than flight. A Saxon bard had called it a feast of the swords&mdash;a
      gathering of the eagles to the prey&mdash;the clashing of bills upon
      shield and helmet, the shouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of
      a bridal. But our bards are no more,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;our deeds are lost in
      those of another race&mdash;our language&mdash;our very name&mdash;is
      hastening to decay, and none mourns for it save one solitary old man&mdash;Cupbearer!
      knave, fill the goblets&mdash;To the strong in arms, Sir Templar, be their
      race or language what it will, who now bear them best in Palestine among
      the champions of the Cross!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It becomes not one wearing this badge to answer,&rdquo; said Sir Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;yet to whom, besides the sworn Champions of the Holy
      Sepulchre, can the palm be assigned among the champions of the Cross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Knights Hospitallers,&rdquo; said the Abbot; &ldquo;I have a brother of their
      order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I impeach not their fame,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;nevertheless&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, friend Cedric,&rdquo; said Wamba, interfering, &ldquo;that had Richard of
      the Lion's Heart been wise enough to have taken a fool's advice, he might
      have staid at home with his merry Englishmen, and left the recovery of
      Jerusalem to those same Knights who had most to do with the loss of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there, then, none in the English army,&rdquo; said the Lady Rowena, &ldquo;whose
      names are worthy to be mentioned with the Knights of the Temple, and of St
      John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, lady,&rdquo; replied De Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;the English monarch did,
      indeed, bring to Palestine a host of gallant warriors, second only to
      those whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second to NONE,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, who had stood near enough to hear, and
      had listened to this conversation with marked impatience. All turned
      toward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was heard.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0087m.jpg" style="width:100%;"  alt="0087m "  /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0087.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; repeated the Pilgrim in a firm and strong voice, &ldquo;that the
      English chivalry were second to NONE who ever drew sword in defence of the
      Holy Land. I say besides, for I saw it, that King Richard himself, and
      five of his knights, held a tournament after the taking of St
      John-de-Acre, as challengers against all comers. I say that, on that day,
      each knight ran three courses, and cast to the ground three antagonists. I
      add, that seven of these assailants were Knights of the Temple&mdash;and
      Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert well knows the truth of what I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage which
      rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the Templar. In the
      extremity of his resentment and confusion, his quivering fingers griped
      towards the handle of his sword, and perhaps only withdrew, from the
      consciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in that
      place and presence. Cedric, whose feelings were all of a right onward and
      simple kind, and were seldom occupied by more than one object at once,
      omitted, in the joyous glee with which he heard of the glory of his
      countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his guest; &ldquo;I would give thee
      this golden bracelet, Pilgrim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;couldst thou tell me the names
      of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown of merry England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I do blithely,&rdquo; replied the Pilgrim, &ldquo;and without guerdon; my
      oath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend Palmer,&rdquo; said
      Wamba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first in honour as in arms, in renown as in place,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim,
      &ldquo;was the brave Richard, King of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive him,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;I forgive him his descent from the tyrant
      Duke William.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Earl of Leicester was the second,&rdquo; continued the Pilgrim; &ldquo;Sir Thomas
      Multon of Gilsland was the third.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Saxon descent, he at least,&rdquo; said Cedric, with exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Foulk Doilly the fourth,&rdquo; proceeded the Pilgrim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saxon also, at least by the mother's side,&rdquo; continued Cedric, who
      listened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least, his
      hatred to the Normans, in the common triumph of the King of England and
      his islanders. &ldquo;And who was the fifth?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fifth was Sir Edwin Turneham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genuine Saxon, by the soul of Hengist!&rdquo; shouted Cedric&mdash;&ldquo;And the
      sixth?&rdquo; he continued with eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;how name you the sixth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sixth,&rdquo; said the Palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to
      recollect himself, &ldquo;was a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank,
      assumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than to
      make up their number&mdash;his name dwells not in my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Palmer,&rdquo; said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert scornfully, &ldquo;this assumed
      forgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too late to serve
      your purpose. I will myself tell the name of the knight before whose lance
      fortune and my horse's fault occasioned my falling&mdash;it was the Knight
      of Ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his years, had more
      renown in arms.&mdash;Yet this will I say, and loudly&mdash;that were he
      in England, and durst repeat, in this week's tournament, the challenge of
      St John-de-Acre, I, mounted and armed as I now am, would give him every
      advantage of weapons, and abide the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your challenge would soon be answered,&rdquo; replied the Palmer, &ldquo;were your
      antagonist near you. As the matter is, disturb not the peaceful hall with
      vaunts of the issue of the conflict, which you well know cannot take
      place. If Ivanhoe ever returns from Palestine, I will be his surety that
      he meets you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A goodly security!&rdquo; said the Knight Templar; &ldquo;and what do you proffer as
      a pledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This reliquary,&rdquo; said the Palmer, taking a small ivory box from his
      bosom, and crossing himself, &ldquo;containing a portion of the true cross,
      brought from the Monastery of Mount Carmel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prior of Jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in
      which all devoutly joined, excepting the Jew, the Mahomedans, and the
      Templar; the latter of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying any
      reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck a gold
      chain, which he flung on the board, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Let Prior Aymer hold my
      pledge and that of this nameless vagrant, in token that when the Knight of
      Ivanhoe comes within the four seas of Britain, he underlies the challenge
      of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, which, if he answer not, I will proclaim him as
      a coward on the walls of every Temple Court in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not need,&rdquo; said the Lady Rowena, breaking silence; &ldquo;My voice
      shall be heard, if no other in this hall is raised in behalf of the absent
      Ivanhoe. I affirm he will meet fairly every honourable challenge. Could my
      weak warrant add security to the inestimable pledge of this holy pilgrim,
      I would pledge name and fame that Ivanhoe gives this proud knight the
      meeting he desires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of conflicting emotions seemed to have occupied Cedric, and kept
      him silent during this discussion. Gratified pride, resentment,
      embarrassment, chased each other over his broad and open brow, like the
      shadow of clouds drifting over a harvest-field; while his attendants, on
      whom the name of the sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost
      electrical, hung in suspense upon their master's looks. But when Rowena
      spoke, the sound of her voice seemed to startle him from his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;this beseems not; were further pledge necessary, I
      myself, offended, and justly offended, as I am, would yet gage my honour
      for the honour of Ivanhoe. But the wager of battle is complete, even
      according to the fantastic fashions of Norman chivalry&mdash;Is it not,
      Father Aymer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the Prior; &ldquo;and the blessed relic and rich chain will I
      bestow safely in the treasury of our convent, until the decision of this
      warlike challenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thus spoken, he crossed himself again and again, and after many
      genuflections and muttered prayers, he delivered the reliquary to Brother
      Ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with less ceremony,
      but perhaps with no less internal satisfaction, the golden chain, and
      bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather, which opened under his
      arm. &ldquo;And now, Sir Cedric,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my ears are chiming vespers with the
      strength of your good wine&mdash;permit us another pledge to the welfare
      of the Lady Rowena, and indulge us with liberty to pass to our repose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the rood of Bromholme,&rdquo; said the Saxon, &ldquo;you do but small credit to
      your fame, Sir Prior! Report speaks you a bonny monk, that would hear the
      matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as I am, I feared to have
      shame in encountering you. But, by my faith, a Saxon boy of twelve, in my
      time, would not so soon have relinquished his goblet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prior had his own reasons, however, for persevering in the course of
      temperance which he had adopted. He was not only a professional
      peacemaker, but from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls. It was not
      altogether from a love to his neighbour, or to himself, or from a mixture
      of both. On the present occasion, he had an instinctive apprehension of
      the fiery temper of the Saxon, and saw the danger that the reckless and
      presumptuous spirit, of which his companion had already given so many
      proofs, might at length produce some disagreeable explosion. He therefore
      gently insinuated the incapacity of the native of any other country to
      engage in the genial conflict of the bowl with the hardy and strong-headed
      Saxons; something he mentioned, but slightly, about his own holy
      character, and ended by pressing his proposal to depart to repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after making
      deep obeisance to their landlord and to the Lady Rowena, arose and mingled
      in the hall, while the heads of the family, by separate doors, retired
      with their attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unbelieving dog,&rdquo; said the Templar to Isaac the Jew, as he passed him in
      the throng, &ldquo;dost thou bend thy course to the tournament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do so propose,&rdquo; replied Isaac, bowing in all humility, &ldquo;if it please
      your reverend valour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;to gnaw the bowels of our nobles with usury, and
      to gull women and boys with gauds and toys&mdash;I warrant thee store of
      shekels in thy Jewish scrip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a shekel, not a silver penny, not a halfling&mdash;so help me the God
      of Abraham!&rdquo; said the Jew, clasping his hands; &ldquo;I go but to seek the
      assistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the fine which
      the Exchequer of the Jews have imposed upon me&mdash;Father Jacob be my
      speed! I am an impoverished wretch&mdash;the very gaberdine I wear is
      borrowed from Reuben of Tadcaster.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-15"      name="linknoteref-15" id="linknoteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Templar smiled sourly as he replied, &ldquo;Beshrew thee for a false-hearted
      liar!&rdquo; and passing onward, as if disdaining farther conference, he
      communed with his Moslem slaves in a language unknown to the bystanders.
      The poor Israelite seemed so staggered by the address of the military
      monk, that the Templar had passed on to the extremity of the hall ere he
      raised his head from the humble posture which he had assumed, so far as to
      be sensible of his departure. And when he did look around, it was with the
      astonished air of one at whose feet a thunderbolt has just burst, and who
      hears still the astounding report ringing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Templar and Prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping
      apartments by the steward and the cupbearer, each attended by two
      torchbearers and two servants carrying refreshments, while servants of
      inferior condition indicated to their retinue and to the other guests
      their respective places of repose.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     To buy his favour I extend this friendship:
     If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
     And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
     &mdash;Merchant of Venice
</pre>
    <p>
      As the Palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the
      intricate combination of apartments of this large and irregular mansion,
      the cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if he had no
      objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment, there were many
      domestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had brought
      from the Holy Land, and particularly that which concerned the Knight of
      Ivanhoe. Wamba presently appeared to urge the same request, observing that
      a cup after midnight was worth three after curfew. Without disputing a
      maxim urged by such grave authority, the Palmer thanked them for their
      courtesy, but observed that he had included in his religious vow, an
      obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were prohibited
      in the hall. &ldquo;That vow,&rdquo; said Wamba to the cupbearer, &ldquo;would scarce suit a
      serving-man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure. &ldquo;I thought to have
      lodged him in the solere chamber,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but since he is so unsocial
      to Christians, e'en let him take the next stall to Isaac the Jew's.&mdash;Anwold,&rdquo;
       said he to the torchbearer, &ldquo;carry the Pilgrim to the southern cell.&mdash;I
      give you good-night,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Sir Palmer, with small thanks for short
      courtesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, and Our Lady's benison,&rdquo; said the Palmer, with composure; and
      his guide moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small antechamber, into which several doors opened, and which was
      lighted by a small iron lamp, they met a second interruption from the
      waiting-maid of Rowena, who, saying in a tone of authority, that her
      mistress desired to speak with the Palmer, took the torch from the hand of
      Anwold, and, bidding him await her return, made a sign to the Palmer to
      follow. Apparently he did not think it proper to decline this invitation
      as he had done the former; for, though his gesture indicated some surprise
      at the summons, he obeyed it without answer or remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short passage, and an ascent of seven steps, each of which was composed
      of a solid beam of oak, led him to the apartment of the Lady Rowena, the
      rude magnificence of which corresponded to the respect which was paid to
      her by the lord of the mansion. The walls were covered with embroidered
      hangings, on which different-coloured silks, interwoven with gold and
      silver threads, had been employed with all the art of which the age was
      capable, to represent the sports of hunting and hawking. The bed was
      adorned with the same rich tapestry, and surrounded with curtains dyed
      with purple. The seats had also their stained coverings, and one, which
      was higher than the rest, was accommodated with a footstool of ivory,
      curiously carved.
    </p>
    <p>
      No fewer than four silver candelabras, holding great waxen torches, served
      to illuminate this apartment. Yet let not modern beauty envy the
      magnificence of a Saxon princess. The walls of the apartment were so ill
      finished and so full of crevices, that the rich hangings shook in the
      night blast, and, in despite of a sort of screen intended to protect them
      from the wind, the flame of the torches streamed sideways into the air,
      like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain. Magnificence there was, with some
      rude attempt at taste; but of comfort there was little, and, being
      unknown, it was unmissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and
      arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated in the sort of
      throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage.
      The Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, Palmer,&rdquo; said she graciously. &ldquo;The defender of the absent has a
      right to favourable reception from all who value truth, and honour
      manhood.&rdquo; She then said to her train, &ldquo;Retire, excepting only Elgitha; I
      would speak with this holy Pilgrim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maidens, without leaving the apartment, retired to its further
      extremity, and sat down on a small bench against the wall, where they
      remained mute as statues, though at such a distance that their whispers
      could not have interrupted the conversation of their mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pilgrim,&rdquo; said the lady, after a moment's pause, during which she seemed
      uncertain how to address him, &ldquo;you this night mentioned a name&mdash;I
      mean,&rdquo; she said, with a degree of effort, &ldquo;the name of Ivanhoe, in the
      halls where by nature and kindred it should have sounded most acceptably;
      and yet, such is the perverse course of fate, that of many whose hearts
      must have throbbed at the sound, I, only, dare ask you where, and in what
      condition, you left him of whom you spoke?&mdash;We heard, that, having
      remained in Palestine, on account of his impaired health, after the
      departure of the English army, he had experienced the persecution of the
      French faction, to whom the Templars are known to be attached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know little of the Knight of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; answered the Palmer, with a
      troubled voice. &ldquo;I would I knew him better, since you, lady, are
      interested in his fate. He hath, I believe, surmounted the persecution of
      his enemies in Palestine, and is on the eve of returning to England, where
      you, lady, must know better than I, what is his chance of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the Knight
      of Ivanhoe might be expected in his native country, and whether he would
      not be exposed to great dangers by the road. On the first point, the
      Palmer professed ignorance; on the second, he said that the voyage might
      be safely made by the way of Venice and Genoa, and from thence through
      France to England. &ldquo;Ivanhoe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was so well acquainted with the
      language and manners of the French, that there was no fear of his
      incurring any hazard during that part of his travels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said the Lady Rowena, &ldquo;he were here safely arrived, and
      able to bear arms in the approaching tourney, in which the chivalry of
      this land are expected to display their address and valour. Should
      Athelstane of Coningsburgh obtain the prize, Ivanhoe is like to hear evil
      tidings when he reaches England.&mdash;How looked he, stranger, when you
      last saw him? Had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and
      comeliness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was darker,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;and thinner, than when he came from
      Cyprus in the train of Coeur-de-Lion, and care seemed to sit heavy on his
      brow; but I approached not his presence, because he is unknown to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I fear, find little in his native land to clear
      those clouds from his countenance. Thanks, good Pilgrim, for your
      information concerning the companion of my childhood.&mdash;Maidens,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;draw near&mdash;offer the sleeping cup to this holy man, whom I
      will no longer detain from repose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich mixture of
      wine and spice, which Rowena barely put to her lips. It was then offered
      to the Palmer, who, after a low obeisance, tasted a few drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept this alms, friend,&rdquo; continued the lady, offering a piece of gold,
      &ldquo;in acknowledgment of thy painful travail, and of the shrines thou hast
      visited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Palmer received the boon with another low reverence, and followed
      Edwina out of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the anteroom he found his attendant Anwold, who, taking the torch from
      the hand of the waiting-maid, conducted him with more haste than ceremony
      to an exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a number of small
      apartments, or rather cells, served for sleeping places to the lower order
      of domestics, and to strangers of mean degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which of these sleeps the Jew?&rdquo; said the Pilgrim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unbelieving dog,&rdquo; answered Anwold, &ldquo;kennels in the cell next your
      holiness.&mdash;St Dunstan, how it must be scraped and cleansed ere it be
      again fit for a Christian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where sleeps Gurth the swineherd?&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gurth,&rdquo; replied the bondsman, &ldquo;sleeps in the cell on your right, as the
      Jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of circumcision
      separate from the abomination of his tribe. You might have occupied a more
      honourable place had you accepted of Oswald's invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as well as it is,&rdquo; said the Palmer; &ldquo;the company, even of a Jew,
      can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch from
      the domestic's hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night. Having shut
      the door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick made of wood,
      and looked around his sleeping apartment, the furniture of which was of
      the most simple kind. It consisted of a rude wooden stool, and still ruder
      hutch or bed-frame, stuffed with clean straw, and accommodated with two or
      three sheepskins by way of bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Palmer, having extinguished his torch, threw himself, without taking
      off any part of his clothes, on this rude couch, and slept, or at least
      retained his recumbent posture, till the earliest sunbeams found their way
      through the little grated window, which served at once to admit both air
      and light to his uncomfortable cell. He then started up, and after
      repeating his matins, and adjusting his dress, he left it, and entered
      that of Isaac the Jew, lifting the latch as gently as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inmate was lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that on
      which the Palmer himself had passed the night. Such parts of his dress as
      the Jew had laid aside on the preceding evening, were disposed carefully
      around his person, as if to prevent the hazard of their being carried off
      during his slumbers. There was a trouble on his brow amounting almost to
      agony. His hands and arms moved convulsively, as if struggling with the
      nightmare; and besides several ejaculations in Hebrew, the following were
      distinctly heard in the Norman-English, or mixed language of the country:
      &ldquo;For the sake of the God of Abraham, spare an unhappy old man! I am poor,
      I am penniless&mdash;should your irons wrench my limbs asunder, I could
      not gratify you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Palmer awaited not the end of the Jew's vision, but stirred him with
      his pilgrim's staff. The touch probably associated, as is usual, with some
      of the apprehensions excited by his dream; for the old man started up, his
      grey hair standing almost erect upon his head, and huddling some part of
      his garments about him, while he held the detached pieces with the
      tenacious grasp of a falcon, he fixed upon the Palmer his keen black eyes,
      expressive of wild surprise and of bodily apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing from me, Isaac,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;I come as your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The God of Israel requite you,&rdquo; said the Jew, greatly relieved; &ldquo;I
      dreamed&mdash;But Father Abraham be praised, it was but a dream.&rdquo; Then,
      collecting himself, he added in his usual tone, &ldquo;And what may it be your
      pleasure to want at so early an hour with the poor Jew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to tell you,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;that if you leave not this mansion
      instantly, and travel not with some haste, your journey may prove a
      dangerous one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy father!&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;whom could it interest to endanger so poor a
      wretch as I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The purpose you can best guess,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim; &ldquo;but rely on this,
      that when the Templar crossed the hall yesternight, he spoke to his
      Mussulman slaves in the Saracen language, which I well understand, and
      charged them this morning to watch the journey of the Jew, to seize upon
      him when at a convenient distance from the mansion, and to conduct him to
      the castle of Philip de Malvoisin, or to that of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon the
      Jew at this information, and seemed at once to overpower his whole
      faculties. His arms fell down to his sides, and his head drooped on his
      breast, his knees bent under his weight, every nerve and muscle of his
      frame seemed to collapse and lose its energy, and he sunk at the foot of
      the Palmer, not in the fashion of one who intentionally stoops, kneels, or
      prostrates himself to excite compassion, but like a man borne down on all
      sides by the pressure of some invisible force, which crushes him to the
      earth without the power of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy God of Abraham!&rdquo; was his first exclamation, folding and elevating
      his wrinkled hands, but without raising his grey head from the pavement;
      &ldquo;Oh, holy Moses! O, blessed Aaron! the dream is not dreamed for nought,
      and the vision cometh not in vain! I feel their irons already tear my
      sinews! I feel the rack pass over my body like the saws, and harrows, and
      axes of iron over the men of Rabbah, and of the cities of the children of
      Ammon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up, Isaac, and hearken to me,&rdquo; said the Palmer, who viewed the
      extremity of his distress with a compassion in which contempt was largely
      mingled; &ldquo;you have cause for your terror, considering how your brethren
      have been used, in order to extort from them their hoards, both by princes
      and nobles; but stand up, I say, and I will point out to you the means of
      escape. Leave this mansion instantly, while its inmates sleep sound after
      the last night's revel. I will guide you by the secret paths of the
      forest, known as well to me as to any forester that ranges it, and I will
      not leave you till you are under safe conduct of some chief or baron going
      to the tournament, whose good-will you have probably the means of
      securing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the ears of Isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech
      intimated, he began gradually, and inch by inch, as it were, to raise
      himself up from the ground, until he fairly rested upon his knees,
      throwing back his long grey hair and beard, and fixing his keen black eyes
      upon the Palmer's face, with a look expressive at once of hope and fear,
      not unmingled with suspicion. But when he heard the concluding part of the
      sentence, his original terror appeared to revive in full force, and he
      dropt once more on his face, exclaiming, &ldquo;'I' possess the means of
      securing good-will! alas! there is but one road to the favour of a
      Christian, and how can the poor Jew find it, whom extortions have already
      reduced to the misery of Lazarus?&rdquo; Then, as if suspicion had overpowered
      his other feelings, he suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;For the love of God, young
      man, betray me not&mdash;for the sake of the Great Father who made us all,
      Jew as well as Gentile, Israelite and Ishmaelite&mdash;do me no treason! I
      have not means to secure the good-will of a Christian beggar, were he
      rating it at a single penny.&rdquo; As he spoke these last words, he raised
      himself, and grasped the Palmer's mantle with a look of the most earnest
      entreaty. The pilgrim extricated himself, as if there were contamination
      in the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
      interest have I to injure thee?&mdash;In this dress I am vowed to poverty,
      nor do I change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail. Yet think
      not that I care for thy company, or propose myself advantage by it; remain
      here if thou wilt&mdash;Cedric the Saxon may protect thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;he will not let me travel in his train&mdash;Saxon
      or Norman will be equally ashamed of the poor Israelite; and to travel by
      myself through the domains of Philip de Malvoisin and Reginald
      Front-de-Boeuf&mdash;Good youth, I will go with you!&mdash;Let us haste&mdash;let
      us gird up our loins&mdash;let us flee!&mdash;Here is thy staff, why wilt
      thou tarry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tarry not,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, giving way to the urgency of his
      companion; &ldquo;but I must secure the means of leaving this place&mdash;follow
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised,
      was occupied by Gurth the swineherd.&mdash;&ldquo;Arise, Gurth,&rdquo; said the
      Pilgrim, &ldquo;arise quickly. Undo the postern gate, and let out the Jew and
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much
      consequence in Saxon England as that of Eumaeus in Ithaca, was offended at
      the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the Palmer. &ldquo;The Jew leaving
      Rotherwood,&rdquo; said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking
      superciliously at him without quitting his pallet, &ldquo;and travelling in
      company with the Palmer to boot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should as soon have dreamt,&rdquo; said Wamba, who entered the apartment at
      the instant, &ldquo;of his stealing away with a gammon of bacon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden log
      which served him for a pillow, &ldquo;both Jew and Gentile must be content to
      abide the opening of the great gate&mdash;we suffer no visitors to depart
      by stealth at these unseasonable hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, in a commanding tone, &ldquo;you will not, I
      think, refuse me that favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd, and
      whispered something in his ear in Saxon. Gurth started up as if
      electrified. The Pilgrim, raising his finger in an attitude as if to
      express caution, added, &ldquo;Gurth, beware&mdash;thou are wont to be prudent.
      I say, undo the postern&mdash;thou shalt know more anon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With hasty alacrity Gurth obeyed him, while Wamba and the Jew followed,
      both wondering at the sudden change in the swineherd's demeanour. &ldquo;My
      mule, my mule!&rdquo; said the Jew, as soon as they stood without the postern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch him his mule,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim; &ldquo;and, hearest thou,&mdash;let me
      have another, that I may bear him company till he is beyond these parts&mdash;I
      will return it safely to some of Cedric's train at Ashby. And do thou&rdquo;&mdash;he
      whispered the rest in Gurth's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, most willingly shall it be done,&rdquo; said Gurth, and instantly
      departed to execute the commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; said Wamba, when his comrade's back was turned, &ldquo;what you
      Palmers learn in the Holy Land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say our orisons, fool,&rdquo; answered the Pilgrim, &ldquo;to repent our sins, and
      to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something more potent than that,&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;for when would
      repentance or prayer make Gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil
      persuade him to lend you a mule?&mdash;I trow you might as well have told
      his favourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, and wouldst have
      gotten as civil an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;thou art but a Saxon fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou sayst well,&rdquo; said the Jester; &ldquo;had I been born a Norman, as I think
      thou art, I would have had luck on my side, and been next door to a wise
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with the
      mules. The travellers crossed the ditch upon a drawbridge of only two
      planks breadth, the narrowness of which was matched with the straitness of
      the postern, and with a little wicket in the exterior palisade, which gave
      access to the forest. No sooner had they reached the mules, than the Jew,
      with hasty and trembling hands, secured behind the saddle a small bag of
      blue buckram, which he took from under his cloak, containing, as he
      muttered, &ldquo;a change of raiment&mdash;only a change of raiment.&rdquo; Then
      getting upon the animal with more alacrity and haste than could have been
      anticipated from his years, he lost no time in so disposing of the skirts
      of his gabardine as to conceal completely from observation the burden
      which he had thus deposited &ldquo;en croupe&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed, his
      hand to Gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration. The
      swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost under the
      boughs of the forest path, when he was disturbed from his reverie by the
      voice of Wamba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowest thou,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;my good friend Gurth, that thou art
      strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning? I
      would I were a black Prior or a barefoot Palmer, to avail myself of thy
      unwonted zeal and courtesy&mdash;certes, I would make more out of it than
      a kiss of the hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art no fool thus far, Wamba,&rdquo; answered Gurth, &ldquo;though thou arguest
      from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more&mdash;But it is time
      to look after my charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the Jester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a
      dispatch which argued the extremity of the Jew's fears, since persons at
      his age are seldom fond of rapid motion. The Palmer, to whom every path
      and outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar, led the way through the
      most devious paths, and more than once excited anew the suspicion of the
      Israelite, that he intended to betray him into some ambuscade of his
      enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      His doubts might have been indeed pardoned; for, except perhaps the flying
      fish, there was no race existing on the earth, in the air, or the waters,
      who were the object of such an unintermitting, general, and relentless
      persecution as the Jews of this period. Upon the slightest and most
      unreasonable pretences, as well as upon accusations the most absurd and
      groundless, their persons and property were exposed to every turn of
      popular fury; for Norman, Saxon, Dane, and Briton, however adverse these
      races were to each other, contended which should look with greatest
      detestation upon a people, whom it was accounted a point of religion to
      hate, to revile, to despise, to plunder, and to persecute. The kings of
      the Norman race, and the independent nobles, who followed their example in
      all acts of tyranny, maintained against this devoted people a persecution
      of a more regular, calculated, and self-interested kind. It is a
      well-known story of King John, that he confined a wealthy Jew in one of
      the royal castles, and daily caused one of his teeth to be torn out,
      until, when the jaw of the unhappy Israelite was half disfurnished, he
      consented to pay a large sum, which it was the tyrant's object to extort
      from him. The little ready money which was in the country was chiefly in
      possession of this persecuted people, and the nobility hesitated not to
      follow the example of their sovereign, in wringing it from them by every
      species of oppression, and even personal torture. Yet the passive courage
      inspired by the love of gain, induced the Jews to dare the various evils
      to which they were subjected, in consideration of the immense profits
      which they were enabled to realize in a country naturally so wealthy as
      England. In spite of every kind of discouragement, and even of the special
      court of taxations already mentioned, called the Jews' Exchequer, erected
      for the very purpose of despoiling and distressing them, the Jews
      increased, multiplied, and accumulated huge sums, which they transferred
      from one hand to another by means of bills of exchange&mdash;an invention
      for which commerce is said to be indebted to them, and which enabled them
      to transfer their wealth from land to land, that when threatened with
      oppression in one country, their treasure might be secured in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obstinacy and avarice of the Jews being thus in a measure placed in
      opposition to the fanaticism that tyranny of those under whom they lived,
      seemed to increase in proportion to the persecution with which they were
      visited; and the immense wealth they usually acquired in commerce, while
      it frequently placed them in danger, was at other times used to extend
      their influence, and to secure to them a certain degree of protection. On
      these terms they lived; and their character, influenced accordingly, was
      watchful, suspicious, and timid&mdash;yet obstinate, uncomplying, and
      skilful in evading the dangers to which they were exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious
      paths, the Palmer at length broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That large decayed oak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;marks the boundaries over which
      Front-de-Boeuf claims authority&mdash;we are long since far from those of
      Malvoisin. There is now no fear of pursuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the wheels of their chariots be taken off,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;like those
      of the host of Pharaoh, that they may drive heavily!&mdash;But leave me
      not, good Pilgrim&mdash;Think but of that fierce and savage Templar, with
      his Saracen slaves&mdash;they will regard neither territory, nor manor,
      nor lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our road,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;should here separate; for it beseems not men
      of my character and thine to travel together longer than needs must be.
      Besides, what succour couldst thou have from me, a peaceful Pilgrim,
      against two armed heathens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O good youth,&rdquo; answered the Jew, &ldquo;thou canst defend me, and I know thou
      wouldst. Poor as I am, I will requite it&mdash;not with money, for money,
      so help me my Father Abraham, I have none&mdash;but&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money and recompense,&rdquo; said the Palmer, interrupting him, &ldquo;I have already
      said I require not of thee. Guide thee I can; and, it may be, even in some
      sort defend thee; since to protect a Jew against a Saracen, can scarce be
      accounted unworthy of a Christian. Therefore, Jew, I will see thee safe
      under some fitting escort. We are now not far from the town of Sheffield,
      where thou mayest easily find many of thy tribe with whom to take refuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blessing of Jacob be upon thee, good youth!&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;in
      Sheffield I can harbour with my kinsman Zareth, and find some means of
      travelling forth with safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the Palmer; &ldquo;at Sheffield then we part, and
      half-an-hour's riding will bring us in sight of that town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts; the Pilgrim
      perhaps disdaining to address the Jew, except in case of absolute
      necessity, and the Jew not presuming to force a conversation with a person
      whose journey to the Holy Sepulchre gave a sort of sanctity to his
      character. They paused on the top of a gently rising bank, and the
      Pilgrim, pointing to the town of Sheffield, which lay beneath them,
      repeated the words, &ldquo;Here, then, we part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till you have had the poor Jew's thanks,&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;for I presume
      not to ask you to go with me to my kinsman Zareth's, who might aid me with
      some means of repaying your good offices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already said,&rdquo; answered the Pilgrim, &ldquo;that I desire no recompense.
      If among the huge list of thy debtors, thou wilt, for my sake, spare the
      gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy Christian who stands in thy danger,
      I shall hold this morning's service to thee well bestowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, stay,&rdquo; said the Jew, laying hold of his garment; &ldquo;something would I
      do more than this, something for thyself.&mdash;God knows the Jew is poor&mdash;yes,
      Isaac is the beggar of his tribe&mdash;but forgive me should I guess what
      thou most lackest at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou wert to guess truly,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;it is what thou canst not
      supply, wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say?&rdquo; echoed the Jew; &ldquo;O! believe it, I say but the truth; I am a
      plundered, indebted, distressed man. Hard hands have wrung from me my
      goods, my money, my ships, and all that I possessed&mdash;Yet I can tell
      thee what thou lackest, and, it may be, supply it too. Thy wish even now
      is for a horse and armour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Palmer started, and turned suddenly towards the Jew:&mdash;&ldquo;What fiend
      prompted that guess?&rdquo; said he, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said the Jew, smiling, &ldquo;so that it be a true one&mdash;and,
      as I can guess thy want, so I can supply it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But consider,&rdquo; said the Palmer, &ldquo;my character, my dress, my vow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you Christians,&rdquo; replied the Jew, &ldquo;and that the noblest of you
      will take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance, and walk afoot to
      visit the graves of dead men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaspheme not, Jew,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;I spoke rashly. But there dropt words from
      you last night and this morning, that, like sparks from flint, showed the
      metal within; and in the bosom of that Palmer's gown, is hidden a knight's
      chain and spurs of gold. They glanced as you stooped over my bed in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilgrim could not forbear smiling. &ldquo;Were thy garments searched by as
      curious an eye, Isaac,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what discoveries might not be made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that,&rdquo; said the Jew, changing colour; and drawing forth his
      writing materials in haste, as if to stop the conversation, he began to
      write upon a piece of paper which he supported on the top of his yellow
      cap, without dismounting from his mule. When he had finished, he delivered
      the scroll, which was in the Hebrew character, to the Pilgrim, saying, &ldquo;In
      the town of Leicester all men know the rich Jew, Kirjath Jairam of
      Lombardy; give him this scroll&mdash;he hath on sale six Milan harnesses,
      the worst would suit a crowned head&mdash;ten goodly steeds, the worst
      might mount a king, were he to do battle for his throne. Of these he will
      give thee thy choice, with every thing else that can furnish thee forth
      for the tournament: when it is over, thou wilt return them safely&mdash;unless
      thou shouldst have wherewith to pay their value to the owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Isaac,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, smiling, &ldquo;dost thou know that in these
      sports, the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed are forfeit to
      his victor? Now I may be unfortunate, and so lose what I cannot replace or
      repay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility; but collecting his
      courage, he replied hastily. &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;It is impossible&mdash;I
      will not think so. The blessing of Our Father will be upon thee. Thy lance
      will be powerful as the rod of Moses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he was turning his mule's head away, when the Palmer, in his
      turn, took hold of his gaberdine. &ldquo;Nay, but Isaac, thou knowest not all
      the risk. The steed may be slain, the armour injured&mdash;for I will
      spare neither horse nor man. Besides, those of thy tribe give nothing for
      nothing; something there must be paid for their use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jew twisted himself in the saddle, like a man in a fit of the colic;
      but his better feelings predominated over those which were most familiar
      to him. &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I care not&mdash;let me go. If there is
      damage, it will cost you nothing&mdash;if there is usage money, Kirjath
      Jairam will forgive it for the sake of his kinsman Isaac. Fare thee well!&mdash;Yet
      hark thee, good youth,&rdquo; said he, turning about, &ldquo;thrust thyself not too
      forward into this vain hurly-burly&mdash;I speak not for endangering the
      steed, and coat of armour, but for the sake of thine own life and limbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gramercy for thy caution,&rdquo; said the Palmer, again smiling; &ldquo;I will use
      thy courtesy frankly, and it will go hard with me but I will requite it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted, and took different roads for the town of Sheffield.

     Knights, with a long retinue of their squires,
     In gaudy liveries march and quaint attires;
     One laced the helm, another held the lance,
     A third the shining buckler did advance.
     The courser paw'd the ground with restless feet,

</pre>
    <p>
      The condition of the English nation was at this time sufficiently
      miserable. King Richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power of the
      perfidious and cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very place of his captivity
      was uncertain, and his fate but very imperfectly known to the generality
      of his subjects, who were, in the meantime, a prey to every species of
      subaltern oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince John, in league with Philip of France, Coeur-de-Lion's mortal
      enemy, was using every species of influence with the Duke of Austria, to
      prolong the captivity of his brother Richard, to whom he stood indebted
      for so many favours. In the meantime, he was strengthening his own faction
      in the kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the succession, in case of
      the King's death, with the legitimate heir, Arthur Duke of Brittany, son
      of Geoffrey Plantagenet, the elder brother of John. This usurpation, it is
      well known, he afterwards effected. His own character being light,
      profligate, and perfidious, John easily attached to his person and
      faction, not only all who had reason to dread the resentment of Richard
      for criminal proceedings during his absence, but also the numerous class
      of &ldquo;lawless resolutes,&rdquo; whom the crusades had turned back on their
      country, accomplished in the vices of the East, impoverished in substance,
      and hardened in character, and who placed their hopes of harvest in civil
      commotion. To these causes of public distress and apprehension, must be
      added, the multitude of outlaws, who, driven to despair by the oppression
      of the feudal nobility, and the severe exercise of the forest laws, banded
      together in large gangs, and, keeping possession of the forests and the
      wastes, set at defiance the justice and magistracy of the country. The
      nobles themselves, each fortified within his own castle, and playing the
      petty sovereign over his own dominions, were the leaders of bands scarce
      less lawless and oppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To
      maintain these retainers, and to support the extravagance and magnificence
      which their pride induced them to affect, the nobility borrowed sums of
      money from the Jews at the most usurious interest, which gnawed into their
      estates like consuming cankers, scarce to be cured unless when
      circumstances gave them an opportunity of getting free, by exercising upon
      their creditors some act of unprincipled violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs, the
      people of England suffered deeply for the present, and had yet more
      dreadful cause to fear for the future. To augment their misery, a
      contagious disorder of a dangerous nature spread through the land; and,
      rendered more virulent by the uncleanness, the indifferent food, and the
      wretched lodging of the lower classes, swept off many whose fate the
      survivors were tempted to envy, as exempting them from the evils which
      were to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the rich, the
      vulgar as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament, which was the
      grand spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the half-starved
      citizen of Madrid, who has not a real left to buy provisions for his
      family, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. Neither duty nor infirmity
      could keep youth or age from such exhibitions. The Passage of Arms, as it
      was called, which was to take place at Ashby, in the county of Leicester,
      as champions of the first renown were to take the field in the presence of
      Prince John himself, who was expected to grace the lists, had attracted
      universal attention, and an immense confluence of persons of all ranks
      hastened upon the appointed morning to the place of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was singularly romantic. On the verge of a wood, which
      approached to within a mile of the town of Ashby, was an extensive meadow,
      of the finest and most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one side by the
      forest, and fringed on the other by straggling oak-trees, some of which
      had grown to an immense size. The ground, as if fashioned on purpose for
      the martial display which was intended, sloped gradually down on all sides
      to a level bottom, which was enclosed for the lists with strong palisades,
      forming a space of a quarter of a mile in length, and about half as broad.
      The form of the enclosure was an oblong square, save that the corners were
      considerably rounded off, in order to afford more convenience for the
      spectators. The openings for the entry of the combatants were at the
      northern and southern extremities of the lists, accessible by strong
      wooden gates, each wide enough to admit two horsemen riding abreast. At
      each of these portals were stationed two heralds, attended by six
      trumpets, as many pursuivants, and a strong body of men-at-arms for
      maintaining order, and ascertaining the quality of the knights who
      proposed to engage in this martial game.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a platform beyond the southern entrance, formed by a natural elevation
      of the ground, were pitched five magnificent pavilions, adorned with
      pennons of russet and black, the chosen colours of the five knights
      challengers. The cords of the tents were of the same colour. Before each
      pavilion was suspended the shield of the knight by whom it was occupied,
      and beside it stood his squire, quaintly disguised as a salvage or silvan
      man, or in some other fantastic dress, according to the taste of his
      master, and the character he was pleased to assume during the game. <a
      href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16"><small>16</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to Brian
      be Bois-Guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, no less than his
      connexions with the knights who had undertaken this Passage of Arms, had
      occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the challengers,
      and even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had so recently
      joined them. On one side of his tent were pitched those of Reginald
      Front-de-Boeuf and Richard de Malvoisin, and on the other was the pavilion
      of Hugh de Grantmesnil, a noble baron in the vicinity, whose ancestor had
      been Lord High Steward of England in the time of the Conqueror, and his
      son William Rufus. Ralph de Vipont, a knight of St John of Jerusalem, who
      had some ancient possessions at a place called Heather, near
      Ashby-de-la-Zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion. From the entrance into
      the lists, a gently sloping passage, ten yards in breadth, led up to the
      platform on which the tents were pitched. It was strongly secured by a
      palisade on each side, as was the esplanade in front of the pavilions, and
      the whole was guarded by men-at-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of
      thirty feet in breadth, at the extremity of which was a large enclosed
      space for such knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the
      challengers, behind which were placed tents containing refreshments of
      every kind for their accommodation, with armourers, tarriers, and other
      attendants, in readiness to give their services wherever they might be
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries,
      spread with tapestry and carpets, and accommodated with cushions for the
      convenience of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend the
      tournament. A narrow space, betwixt these galleries and the lists, gave
      accommodation for yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than the mere
      vulgar, and might be compared to the pit of a theatre. The promiscuous
      multitude arranged themselves upon large banks of turf prepared for the
      purpose, which, aided by the natural elevation of the ground, enabled them
      to overlook the galleries, and obtain a fair view into the lists. Besides
      the accommodation which these stations afforded, many hundreds had perched
      themselves on the branches of the trees which surrounded the meadow; and
      even the steeple of a country church, at some distance, was crowded with
      spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that one
      gallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, and
      consequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat
      was to take place, was raised higher than the others, more richly
      decorated, and graced by a sort of throne and canopy, on which the royal
      arms were emblazoned. Squires, pages, and yeomen in rich liveries, waited
      around this place of honour, which was designed for Prince John and his
      attendants. Opposite to this royal gallery was another, elevated to the
      same height, on the western side of the lists; and more gaily, if less
      sumptuously decorated, than that destined for the Prince himself. A train
      of pages and of young maidens, the most beautiful who could be selected,
      gaily dressed in fancy habits of green and pink, surrounded a throne
      decorated in the same colours. Among pennons and flags bearing wounded
      hearts, burning hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and quivers, and all the
      commonplace emblems of the triumphs of Cupid, a blazoned inscription
      informed the spectators, that this seat of honour was designed for &ldquo;La
      Royne de las Beaulte et des Amours&rdquo;. But who was to represent the Queen of
      Beauty and of Love on the present occasion no one was prepared to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy
      their respective stations, and not without many quarrels concerning those
      which they were entitled to hold. Some of these were settled by the
      men-at-arms with brief ceremony; the shafts of their battle-axes, and
      pummels of their swords, being readily employed as arguments to convince
      the more refractory. Others, which involved the rival claims of more
      elevated persons, were determined by the heralds, or by the two marshals
      of the field, William de Wyvil, and Stephen de Martival, who, armed at all
      points, rode up and down the lists to enforce and preserve good order
      among the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the galleries became filled with knights and nobles, in their
      robes of peace, whose long and rich-tinted mantles were contrasted with
      the gayer and more splendid habits of the ladies, who, in a greater
      proportion than even the men themselves, thronged to witness a sport,
      which one would have thought too bloody and dangerous to afford their sex
      much pleasure. The lower and interior space was soon filled by substantial
      yeomen and burghers, and such of the lesser gentry, as, from modesty,
      poverty, or dubious title, durst not assume any higher place. It was of
      course amongst these that the most frequent disputes for precedence
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog of an unbeliever,&rdquo; said an old man, whose threadbare tunic bore
      witness to his poverty, as his sword, and dagger, and golden chain
      intimated his pretensions to rank,&mdash;&ldquo;whelp of a she-wolf! darest thou
      press upon a Christian, and a Norman gentleman of the blood of
      Montdidier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our acquaintance
      Isaac, who, richly and even magnificently dressed in a gaberdine
      ornamented with lace and lined with fur, was endeavouring to make place in
      the foremost row beneath the gallery for his daughter, the beautiful
      Rebecca, who had joined him at Ashby, and who was now hanging on her
      father's arm, not a little terrified by the popular displeasure which
      seemed generally excited by her parent's presumption. But Isaac, though we
      have seen him sufficiently timid on other occasions, knew well that at
      present he had nothing to fear. It was not in places of general resort, or
      where their equals were assembled, that any avaricious or malevolent noble
      durst offer him injury. At such meetings the Jews were under the
      protection of the general law; and if that proved a weak assurance, it
      usually happened that there were among the persons assembled some barons,
      who, for their own interested motives, were ready to act as their
      protectors. On the present occasion, Isaac felt more than usually
      confident, being aware that Prince John was even then in the very act of
      negotiating a large loan from the Jews of York, to be secured upon certain
      jewels and lands. Isaac's own share in this transaction was considerable,
      and he well knew that the Prince's eager desire to bring it to a
      conclusion would ensure him his protection in the dilemma in which he
      stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and jostled
      the Norman Christian, without respect either to his descent, quality, or
      religion. The complaints of the old man, however, excited the indignation
      of the bystanders. One of these, a stout well-set yeoman, arrayed in
      Lincoln green, having twelve arrows stuck in his belt, with a baldric and
      badge of silver, and a bow of six feet length in his hand, turned short
      round, and while his countenance, which his constant exposure to weather
      had rendered brown as a hazel nut, grew darker with anger, he advised the
      Jew to remember that all the wealth he had acquired by sucking the blood
      of his miserable victims had but swelled him like a bloated spider, which
      might be overlooked while he kept in a corner, but would be crushed if it
      ventured into the light. This intimation, delivered in Norman-English with
      a firm voice and a stern aspect, made the Jew shrink back; and he would
      have probably withdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous,
      had not the attention of every one been called to the sudden entrance of
      Prince John, who at that moment entered the lists, attended by a numerous
      and gay train, consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as light
      in their dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions. Among
      the latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a
      dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and gold were not
      spared in his garments; and the points of his boots, out-heroding the
      preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very far, as to be
      attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very girdle, and effectually
      prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup. This, however, was a
      slight inconvenience to the gallant Abbot, who, perhaps, even rejoicing in
      the opportunity to display his accomplished horsemanship before so many
      spectators, especially of the fair sex, dispensed with the use of these
      supports to a timid rider. The rest of Prince John's retinue consisted of
      the favourite leaders of his mercenary troops, some marauding barons and
      profligate attendants upon the court, with several Knights Templars and
      Knights of St John.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were
      accounted hostile to King Richard, having adopted the side of Philip of
      France in the long train of disputes which took place in Palestine betwixt
      that monarch and the lion-hearted King of England. It was the well-known
      consequence of this discord that Richard's repeated victories had been
      rendered fruitless, his romantic attempts to besiege Jerusalem
      disappointed, and the fruit of all the glory which he had acquired had
      dwindled into an uncertain truce with the Sultan Saladin. With the same
      policy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren in the Holy Land,
      the Templars and Hospitallers in England and Normandy attached themselves
      to the faction of Prince John, having little reason to desire the return
      of Richard to England, or the succession of Arthur, his legitimate heir.
      For the opposite reason, Prince John hated and contemned the few Saxon
      families of consequence which subsisted in England, and omitted no
      opportunity of mortifying and affronting them; being conscious that his
      person and pretensions were disliked by them, as well as by the greater
      part of the English commons, who feared farther innovation upon their
      rights and liberties, from a sovereign of John's licentious and tyrannical
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attended by this gallant equipage, himself well mounted, and splendidly
      dressed in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand a falcon, and having
      his head covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of precious
      stones, from which his long curled hair escaped and overspread his
      shoulders, Prince John, upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey, caracoled
      within the lists at the head of his jovial party, laughing loud with his
      train, and eyeing with all the boldness of royal criticism the beauties
      who adorned the lofty galleries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who remarked in the physiognomy of the Prince a dissolute audacity,
      mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the feelings of
      others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of comeliness which
      belongs to an open set of features, well formed by nature, modelled by art
      to the usual rules of courtesy, yet so far frank and honest, that they
      seemed as if they disclaimed to conceal the natural workings of the soul.
      Such an expression is often mistaken for manly frankness, when in truth it
      arises from the reckless indifference of a libertine disposition,
      conscious of superiority of birth, of wealth, or of some other
      adventitious advantage, totally unconnected with personal merit. To those
      who did not think so deeply, and they were the greater number by a hundred
      to one, the splendour of Prince John's &ldquo;rheno&rdquo;, (i.e. fur tippet,) the
      richness of his cloak, lined with the most costly sables, his maroquin
      boots and golden spurs, together with the grace with which he managed his
      palfrey, were sufficient to merit clamorous applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the Prince was
      called by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attended the
      ambitious movement of Isaac towards the higher places of the assembly. The
      quick eye of Prince John instantly recognised the Jew, but was much more
      agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of Zion, who, terrified by
      the tumult, clung close to the arm of her aged father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure of Rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest
      beauties of England, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a
      connoisseur as Prince John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and was
      shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore according to
      the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban of yellow silk suited
      well with the darkness of her complexion. The brilliancy of her eyes, the
      superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as
      white as pearl, and the profusion of her sable tresses, which, each
      arranged in its own little spiral of twisted curls, fell down upon as much
      of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk,
      exhibiting flowers in their natural colours embossed upon a purple ground,
      permitted to be visible&mdash;all these constituted a combination of
      loveliness, which yielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens who
      surrounded her. It is true, that of the golden and pearl-studded clasps,
      which closed her vest from the throat to the waist, the three uppermost
      were left unfastened on account of the heat, which somewhat enlarged the
      prospect to which we allude. A diamond necklace, with pendants of
      inestimable value, were by this means also made more conspicuous. The
      feather of an ostrich, fastened in her turban by an agraffe set with
      brilliants, was another distinction of the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and
      sneered at by the proud dames who sat above her, but secretly envied by
      those who affected to deride them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bald scalp of Abraham,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;yonder Jewess must be
      the very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic the wisest
      king that ever lived! What sayest thou, Prior Aymer?&mdash;By the Temple
      of that wise king, which our wiser brother Richard proved unable to
      recover, she is the very Bride of the Canticles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley,&rdquo;&mdash;answered the Prior,
      in a sort of snuffling tone; &ldquo;but your Grace must remember she is still
      but a Jewess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; added Prince John, without heeding him, &ldquo;and there is my Mammon of
      unrighteousness too&mdash;the Marquis of Marks, the Baron of Byzants,
      contesting for place with penniless dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have not
      a single cross in their pouches to keep the devil from dancing there. By
      the body of St Mark, my prince of supplies, with his lovely Jewess, shall
      have a place in the gallery!&mdash;What is she, Isaac? Thy wife or thy
      daughter, that Eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as thou
      wouldst thy treasure-casket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter Rebecca, so please your Grace,&rdquo; answered Isaac, with a low
      congee, nothing embarrassed by the Prince's salutation, in which, however,
      there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wiser man thou,&rdquo; said John, with a peal of laughter, in which his gay
      followers obsequiously joined. &ldquo;But, daughter or wife, she should be
      preferred according to her beauty and thy merits.&mdash;Who sits above
      there?&rdquo; he continued, bending his eye on the gallery. &ldquo;Saxon churls,
      lolling at their lazy length!&mdash;out upon them!&mdash;let them sit
      close, and make room for my prince of usurers and his lovely daughter.
      I'll make the hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue
      with those whom the synagogue properly belongs to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite speech
      was addressed, were the family of Cedric the Saxon, with that of his ally
      and kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a personage, who, on account of
      his descent from the last Saxon monarchs of England, was held in the
      highest respect by all the Saxon natives of the north of England. But with
      the blood of this ancient royal race, many of their infirmities had
      descended to Athelstane. He was comely in countenance, bulky and strong in
      person, and in the flower of his age&mdash;yet inanimate in expression,
      dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and sluggish in all his motions, and so
      slow in resolution, that the soubriquet of one of his ancestors was
      conferred upon him, and he was very generally called Athelstane the
      Unready. His friends, and he had many, who, as well as Cedric, were
      passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish temper arose
      not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision; others alleged
      that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his faculties, never
      of a very acute order, and that the passive courage and meek good-nature
      which remained behind, were merely the dregs of a character that might
      have been deserving of praise, but of which all the valuable parts had
      flown off in the progress of a long course of brutal debauchery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to this person, such as we have described him, that the Prince
      addressed his imperious command to make place for Isaac and Rebecca.
      Athelstane, utterly confounded at an order which the manners and feelings
      of the times rendered so injuriously insulting, unwilling to obey, yet
      undetermined how to resist, opposed only the &ldquo;vis inertiae&rdquo; to the will of
      John; and, without stirring or making any motion whatever of obedience,
      opened his large grey eyes, and stared at the Prince with an astonishment
      which had in it something extremely ludicrous. But the impatient John
      regarded it in no such light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Saxon porker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is either asleep or minds me not&mdash;Prick
      him with your lance, De Bracy,&rdquo; speaking to a knight who rode near him,
      the leader of a band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of
      mercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the time
      to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the
      attendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession freed him from
      all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated the
      gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of the Prince
      before Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind sufficient
      even to draw back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric, as prompt as
      his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of lightning, the
      short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed the point of the
      lance from the handle. The blood rushed into the countenance of Prince
      John. He swore one of his deepest oaths, and was about to utter some
      threat corresponding in violence, when he was diverted from his purpose,
      partly by his own attendants, who gathered around him conjuring him to be
      patient, partly by a general exclamation of the crowd, uttered in loud
      applause of the spirited conduct of Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes in
      indignation, as if to collect some safe and easy victim; and chancing to
      encounter the firm glance of the same archer whom we have already noticed,
      and who seemed to persist in his gesture of applause, in spite of the
      frowning aspect which the Prince bent upon him, he demanded his reason for
      clamouring thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always add my hollo,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;when I see a good shot, or a
      gallant blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sayst thou?&rdquo; answered the Prince; &ldquo;then thou canst hit the white thyself,
      I'll warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woodsman's mark, and at woodsman's distance, I can hit,&rdquo; answered the
      yeoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Wat Tyrrel's mark, at a hundred yards,&rdquo; said a voice from behind, but
      by whom uttered could not be discerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allusion to the fate of William Rufus, his Relative, at once incensed
      and alarmed Prince John. He satisfied himself, however, with commanding
      the men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on the braggart,
      pointing to the yeoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Grizzel,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we will try his own skill, who is so ready to
      give his voice to the feats of others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not fly the trial,&rdquo; said the yeoman, with the composure which
      marked his whole deportment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon churls,&rdquo; said the fiery Prince; &ldquo;for, by
      the light of Heaven, since I have said it, the Jew shall have his seat
      amongst ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, an it please your Grace!&mdash;it is not fit for such as we
      to sit with the rulers of the land,&rdquo; said the Jew; whose ambition for
      precedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated and
      impoverished descendant of the line of Montdidier, by no means stimulated
      him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy Saxons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up, infidel dog when I command you,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;or I will have
      thy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus urged, the Jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led
      up to the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;who dare stop him,&rdquo; fixing his eye on
      Cedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the Jew down
      headlong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catastrophe was prevented by the clown Wamba, who, springing betwixt
      his master and Isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to the Prince's defiance,
      &ldquo;Marry, that will I!&rdquo; opposed to the beard of the Jew a shield of brawn,
      which he plucked from beneath his cloak, and with which, doubtless, he had
      furnished himself, lest the tournament should have proved longer than his
      appetite could endure abstinence. Finding the abomination of his tribe
      opposed to his very nose, while the Jester, at the same time, flourished
      his wooden sword above his head, the Jew recoiled, missed his footing, and
      rolled down the steps,&mdash;an excellent jest to the spectators, who set
      up a loud laughter, in which Prince John and his attendants heartily
      joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deal me the prize, cousin Prince,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;I have vanquished my foe
      in fair fight with sword and shield,&rdquo; he added, brandishing the brawn in
      one hand and the wooden sword in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, and what art thou, noble champion?&rdquo; said Prince John, still
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fool by right of descent,&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;I am Wamba, the son of
      Witless, who was the son of Weatherbrain, who was the son of an Alderman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make room for the Jew in front of the lower ring,&rdquo; said Prince John, not
      unwilling perhaps to, seize an apology to desist from his original
      purpose; &ldquo;to place the vanquished beside the victor were false heraldry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knave upon fool were worse,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;and Jew upon bacon
      worst of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gramercy! good fellow,&rdquo; cried Prince John, &ldquo;thou pleasest me&mdash;Here,
      Isaac, lend me a handful of byzants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling to
      comply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and was
      perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a handful,
      the Prince stooped from his jennet and settled Isaac's doubts by snatching
      the pouch itself from his side; and flinging to Wamba a couple of the gold
      pieces which it contained, he pursued his career round the lists, leaving
      the Jew to the derision of those around him, and himself receiving as much
      applause from the spectators as if he had done some honest and honourable
      action.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     At this the challenger with fierce defy
     His trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply:
     With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky.
     Their visors closed, their lances in the rest,
     Or at the helmet pointed or the crest,
     They vanish from the barrier, speed the race,

     Palamon and Arcite
</pre>
    <p>
      In the midst of Prince John's cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and appealing
      to the Prior of Jorvaulx, declared the principal business of the day had
      been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my halidom,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have forgotten, Sir Prior, to name the fair
      Sovereign of Love and of Beauty, by whose white hand the palm is to be
      distributed. For my part, I am liberal in my ideas, and I care not if I
      give my vote for the black-eyed Rebecca.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin,&rdquo; answered the Prior, turning up his eyes in horror, &ldquo;a
      Jewess!&mdash;We should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and I am
      not yet old enough to be a martyr. Besides, I swear by my patron saint,
      that she is far inferior to the lovely Saxon, Rowena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saxon or Jew,&rdquo; answered the Prince, &ldquo;Saxon or Jew, dog or hog, what
      matters it? I say, name Rebecca, were it only to mortify the Saxon
      churls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This passes a jest, my lord,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;no knight here will lay
      lance in rest if such an insult is attempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the mere wantonness of insult,&rdquo; said one of the oldest and most
      important of Prince John's followers, Waldemar Fitzurse, &ldquo;and if your
      Grace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entertained you, sir,&rdquo; said John, reining up his palfrey haughtily,
      &ldquo;for my follower, but not for my counsellor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who follow your Grace in the paths which you tread,&rdquo; said Waldemar,
      but speaking in a low voice, &ldquo;acquire the right of counsellors; for your
      interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the tone in which this was spoken, John saw the necessity of
      acquiescence &ldquo;I did but jest,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you turn upon me like so many
      adders! Name whom you will, in the fiend's name, and please yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;let the fair sovereign's throne remain
      unoccupied, until the conqueror shall be named, and then let him choose
      the lady by whom it shall be filled. It will add another grace to his
      triumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights, who
      can exalt them to such distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Brian de Bois-Guilbert gain the prize,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;I will gage
      my rosary that I name the Sovereign of Love and Beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;is a good lance; but there are others
      around these lists, Sir Prior, who will not fear to encounter him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, sirs,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;and let the Prince assume his seat. The
      knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances, and highly
      fit it is that the sports should commence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John, though not yet a monarch, had in Waldemar Fitzurse all the
      inconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign,
      must always do so in his own way. The Prince acquiesced, however, although
      his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be obstinate
      upon trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded by his
      followers, gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the
      tournament, which were briefly as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the five challengers were to undertake all comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, any knight proposing to combat, might, if he pleased, select a
      special antagonist from among the challengers, by touching his shield. If
      he did so with the reverse of his lance, the trial of skill was made with
      what were called the arms of courtesy, that is, with lances at whose
      extremity a piece of round flat board was fixed, so that no danger was
      encountered, save from the shock of the horses and riders. But if the
      shield was touched with the sharp end of the lance, the combat was
      understood to be at &ldquo;outrance&rdquo;, that is, the knights were to fight with
      sharp weapons, as in actual battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, when the knights present had accomplished their vow, by each of
      them breaking five lances, the Prince was to declare the victor in the
      first day's tourney, who should receive as prize a warhorse of exquisite
      beauty and matchless strength; and in addition to this reward of valour,
      it was now declared, he should have the peculiar honour of naming the
      Queen of Love and Beauty, by whom the prize should be given on the ensuing
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a
      general tournament, in which all the knights present, who were desirous to
      win praise, might take part; and being divided into two bands of equal
      numbers, might fight it out manfully, until the signal was given by Prince
      John to cease the combat. The elected Queen of Love and Beauty was then to
      crown the knight whom the Prince should adjudge to have borne himself best
      in this second day, with a coronet composed of thin gold plate, cut into
      the shape of a laurel crown. On this second day the knightly games ceased.
      But on that which was to follow, feats of archery, of bull-baiting, and
      other popular amusements, were to be practised, for the more immediate
      amusement of the populace. In this manner did Prince John endeavour to lay
      the foundation of a popularity, which he was perpetually throwing down by
      some inconsiderate act of wanton aggression upon the feelings and
      prejudices of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lists now presented a most splendid spectacle. The sloping galleries
      were crowded with all that was noble, great, wealthy, and beautiful in the
      northern and midland parts of England; and the contrast of the various
      dresses of these dignified spectators, rendered the view as gay as it was
      rich, while the interior and lower space, filled with the substantial
      burgesses and yeomen of merry England, formed, in their more plain attire,
      a dark fringe, or border, around this circle of brilliant embroidery,
      relieving, and, at the same time, setting off its splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heralds finished their proclamation with their usual cry of &ldquo;Largesse,
      largesse, gallant knights!&rdquo; and gold and silver pieces were showered on
      them from the galleries, it being a high point of chivalry to exhibit
      liberality towards those whom the age accounted at once the secretaries
      and the historians of honour. The bounty of the spectators was
      acknowledged by the customary shouts of &ldquo;Love of Ladies&mdash;Death of
      Champions&mdash;Honour to the Generous&mdash;Glory to the Brave!&rdquo; To which
      the more humble spectators added their acclamations, and a numerous band
      of trumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments. When these sounds
      had ceased, the heralds withdrew from the lists in gay and glittering
      procession, and none remained within them save the marshals of the field,
      who, armed cap-a-pie, sat on horseback, motionless as statues, at the
      opposite ends of the lists. Meantime, the enclosed space at the northern
      extremity of the lists, large as it was, was now completely crowded with
      knights desirous to prove their skill against the challengers, and, when
      viewed from the galleries, presented the appearance of a sea of waving
      plumage, intermixed with glistening helmets, and tall lances, to the
      extremities of which were, in many cases, attached small pennons of about
      a span's breadth, which, fluttering in the air as the breeze caught them,
      joined with the restless motion of the feathers to add liveliness to the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the barriers were opened, and five knights, chosen by lot,
      advanced slowly into the area; a single champion riding in front, and the
      other four following in pairs. All were splendidly armed, and my Saxon
      authority (in the Wardour Manuscript) records at great length their
      devices, their colours, and the embroidery of their horse trappings. It is
      unnecessary to be particular on these subjects. To borrow lines from a
      contemporary poet, who has written but too little:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The knights are dust,
     And their good swords are rust,
     Their souls are with the saints, we trust.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-17"      name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17">17</a>
</pre>
    <p>
      Their escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles.
      Their castles themselves are but green mounds and shattered ruins&mdash;the
      place that once knew them, knows them no more&mdash;nay, many a race since
      theirs has died out and been forgotten in the very land which they
      occupied, with all the authority of feudal proprietors and feudal lords.
      What, then, would it avail the reader to know their names, or the
      evanescent symbols of their martial rank!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their names
      and feats, the champions advanced through the lists, restraining their
      fiery steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the same time,
      they exhibited their paces, together with the grace and dexterity of the
      riders. As the procession entered the lists, the sound of a wild Barbaric
      music was heard from behind the tents of the challengers, where the
      performers were concealed. It was of Eastern origin, having been brought
      from the Holy Land; and the mixture of the cymbals and bells seemed to bid
      welcome at once, and defiance, to the knights as they advanced. With the
      eyes of an immense concourse of spectators fixed upon them, the five
      knights advanced up the platform upon which the tents of the challengers
      stood, and there separating themselves, each touched slightly, and with
      the reverse of his lance, the shield of the antagonist to whom he wished
      to oppose himself. The lower orders of spectators in general&mdash;nay,
      many of the higher class, and it is even said several of the ladies, were
      rather disappointed at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy. For
      the same sort of persons, who, in the present day, applaud most highly the
      deepest tragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in
      proportion to the danger incurred by the champions engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions retreated to
      the extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up in a line; while
      the challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their horses,
      and, headed by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descended from the platform, and
      opposed themselves individually to the knights who had touched their
      respective shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the flourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against each
      other at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity or good fortune
      of the challengers, that those opposed to Bois-Guilbert, Malvoisin, and
      Front-de-Boeuf, rolled on the ground. The antagonist of Grantmesnil,
      instead of bearing his lance-point fair against the crest or the shield of
      his enemy, swerved so much from the direct line as to break the weapon
      athwart the person of his opponent&mdash;a circumstance which was
      accounted more disgraceful than that of being actually unhorsed; because
      the latter might happen from accident, whereas the former evinced
      awkwardness and want of management of the weapon and of the horse. The
      fifth knight alone maintained the honour of his party, and parted fairly
      with the Knight of St John, both splintering their lances without
      advantage on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations of the
      heralds, and the clangour of the trumpets, announced the triumph of the
      victors and the defeat of the vanquished. The former retreated to their
      pavilions, and the latter, gathering themselves up as they could, withdrew
      from the lists in disgrace and dejection, to agree with their victors
      concerning the redemption of their arms and their horses, which, according
      to the laws of the tournament, they had forfeited. The fifth of their
      number alone tarried in the lists long enough to be greeted by the
      applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he retreated, to the
      aggravation, doubtless, of his companions' mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second and a third party of knights took the field; and although they
      had various success, yet, upon the whole, the advantage decidedly remained
      with the challengers, not one of whom lost his seat or swerved from his
      charge&mdash;misfortunes which befell one or two of their antagonists in
      each encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed to them, seemed
      to be considerably damped by their continued success. Three knights only
      appeared on the fourth entry, who, avoiding the shields of Bois-Guilbert
      and Front-de-Boeuf, contented themselves with touching those of the three
      other knights, who had not altogether manifested the same strength and
      dexterity. This politic selection did not alter the fortune of the field,
      the challengers were still successful: one of their antagonists was
      overthrown, and both the others failed in the &ldquo;attaint&rdquo;, <a
      href="#linknote-18" name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18"><small>18</small></a>
      that is, in striking the helmet and shield of their antagonist firmly and
      strongly, with the lance held in a direct line, so that the weapon might
      break unless the champion was overthrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this fourth encounter, there was a considerable pause; nor did it
      appear that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest. The
      spectators murmured among themselves; for, among the challengers,
      Malvoisin and Front-de-Boeuf were unpopular from their characters, and the
      others, except Grantmesnil, were disliked as strangers and foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      But none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as Cedric
      the Saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by the Norman challengers, a
      repeated triumph over the honour of England. His own education had taught
      him no skill in the games of chivalry, although, with the arms of his
      Saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself, on many occasions, a brave and
      determined soldier. He looked anxiously to Athelstane, who had learned the
      accomplishments of the age, as if desiring that he should make some
      personal effort to recover the victory which was passing into the hands of
      the Templar and his associates. But, though both stout of heart, and
      strong of person, Athelstane had a disposition too inert and unambitious
      to make the exertions which Cedric seemed to expect from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day is against England, my lord,&rdquo; said Cedric, in a marked tone; &ldquo;are
      you not tempted to take the lance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tilt to-morrow&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;in the 'melee'; it is not
      worth while for me to arm myself to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained the Norman word
      &ldquo;melee&rdquo;, (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced some
      indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by
      Athelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not trust
      himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he had no time to
      make any remark, for Wamba thrust in his word, observing, &ldquo;It was better,
      though scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred, than the best
      man of two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but Cedric, who
      better understood the Jester's meaning, darted at him a severe and
      menacing look; and lucky it was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and
      place prevented his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service, more
      sensible marks of his master's resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted, excepting by the
      voices of the heralds exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Love of ladies, splintering of
      lances! stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts
      expressive of triumph or defiance, while the clowns grudged a holiday
      which seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles
      lamented in whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the triumphs of
      their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now supply dames of
      such transcendent beauty as had animated the jousts of former times.
      Prince John began to talk to his attendants about making ready the
      banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the prize to Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown two knights, and
      foiled a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of
      those long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence of
      the lists, it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note of
      defiance from the northern extremity. All eyes were turned to see the new
      champion which these sounds announced, and no sooner were the barriers
      opened than he paced into the lists. As far as could be judged of a man
      sheathed in armour, the new adventurer did not greatly exceed the middle
      size, and seemed to be rather slender than strongly made. His suit of
      armour was formed of steel, richly inlaid with gold, and the device on his
      shield was a young oak-tree pulled up by the roots, with the Spanish word
      Desdichado, signifying Disinherited. He was mounted on a gallant black
      horse, and as he passed through the lists he gracefully saluted the Prince
      and the ladies by lowering his lance. The dexterity with which he managed
      his steed, and something of youthful grace which he displayed in his
      manner, won him the favour of the multitude, which some of the lower
      classes expressed by calling out, &ldquo;Touch Ralph de Vipont's shield&mdash;touch
      the Hospitallers shield; he has the least sure seat, he is your cheapest
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, ascended the
      platform by the sloping alley which led to it from the lists, and, to the
      astonishment of all present, riding straight up to the central pavilion,
      struck with the sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert until it rung again. All stood astonished at his
      presumption, but none more than the redoubted Knight whom he had thus
      defied to mortal combat, and who, little expecting so rude a challenge,
      was standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you confessed yourself, brother,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;and have you
      heard mass this morning, that you peril your life so frankly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fitter to meet death than thou art&rdquo; answered the Disinherited
      Knight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books of
      the tourney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take your place in the lists,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;and look your
      last upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gramercy for thy courtesy,&rdquo; replied the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;and to
      requite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance, for by my
      honour you will need both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward
      down the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same manner
      to move backward through the lists, till he reached the northern
      extremity, where he remained stationary, in expectation of his antagonist.
      This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of the multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      However incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he
      recommended, Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not neglect his advice; for his
      honour was too nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means which
      might ensure victory over his presumptuous opponent. He changed his horse
      for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit. He chose a new
      and a tough spear, lest the wood of the former might have been strained in
      the previous encounters he had sustained. Lastly, he laid aside his
      shield, which had received some little damage, and received another from
      his squires. His first had only borne the general device of his rider,
      representing two knights riding upon one horse, an emblem expressive of
      the original humility and poverty of the Templars, qualities which they
      had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth that finally occasioned
      their suppression. Bois-Guilbert's new shield bore a raven in full flight,
      holding in its claws a skull, and bearing the motto, &ldquo;Gare le Corbeau&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two extremities
      of the lists, the public expectation was strained to the highest pitch.
      Few augured the possibility that the encounter could terminate well for
      the Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and gallantry secured the general
      good wishes of the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished
      from their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in the centre of
      the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt. The lances burst into shivers
      up to the very grasp, and it seemed at the moment that both knights had
      fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil backwards upon its
      haunches. The address of the riders recovered their steeds by use of the
      bridle and spur; and having glared on each other for an instant with eyes
      which seemed to flash fire through the bars of their visors, each made a
      demi-volte, and, retiring to the extremity of the lists, received a fresh
      lance from the attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs, and
      general acclamations, attested the interest taken by the spectators in
      this encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which had
      graced the day. But no sooner had the knights resumed their station, than
      the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence, so deep and so dead,
      that it seemed the multitude were afraid even to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their
      horses might recover breath, Prince John with his truncheon signed to the
      trumpets to sound the onset. The champions a second time sprung from their
      stations, and closed in the centre of the lists, with the same speed, the
      same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal fortune as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the centre of his
      antagonist's shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear
      went to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight reeled in his saddle. On the
      other hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career, directed
      the point of his lance towards Bois-Guilbert's shield, but, changing his
      aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed it to the helmet, a
      mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained, rendered the shock
      more irresistible. Fair and true he hit the Norman on the visor, where his
      lance's point kept hold of the bars. Yet, even at this disadvantage, the
      Templar sustained his high reputation; and had not the girths of his
      saddle burst, he might not have been unhorsed. As it chanced, however,
      saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the ground under a cloud of dust.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      To extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the
      Templar scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness, both at his
      disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the
      spectators, he drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror.
      The Disinherited Knight sprung from his steed, and also unsheathed his
      sword. The marshals of the field, however, spurred their horses between
      them, and reminded them, that the laws of the tournament did not, on the
      present occasion, permit this species of encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall meet again, I trust,&rdquo; said the Templar, casting a resentful
      glance at his antagonist; &ldquo;and where there are none to separate us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we do not,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;the fault shall not be
      mine. On foot or horseback, with spear, with axe, or with sword, I am
      alike ready to encounter thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals,
      crossing their lances betwixt them, compelled them to separate. The
      Disinherited Knight returned to his first station, and Bois-Guilbert to
      his tent, where he remained for the rest of the day in an agony of
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of wine,
      and opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet, announced that he
      quaffed it, &ldquo;To all true English hearts, and to the confusion of foreign
      tyrants.&rdquo; He then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance to the
      challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he should make
      no election, but was willing to encounter them in the order in which they
      pleased to advance against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gigantic Front-de-Boeuf, armed in sable armour, was the first who took
      the field. He bore on a white shield a black bull's head, half defaced by
      the numerous encounters which he had undergone, and bearing the arrogant
      motto, &ldquo;Cave, Adsum&rdquo;. Over this champion the Disinherited Knight obtained
      a slight but decisive advantage. Both Knights broke their lances fairly,
      but Front-de-Boeuf, who lost a stirrup in the encounter, was adjudged to
      have the disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stranger's third encounter with Sir Philip Malvoisin, he was
      equally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque, that
      the laces of the helmet broke, and Malvoisin, only saved from falling by
      being unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his fourth combat with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited Knight showed
      as much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and dexterity. De
      Grantmesnil's horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged in
      the course of the career so as to disturb the rider's aim, and the
      stranger, declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded
      him, raised his lance, and passing his antagonist without touching him,
      wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists,
      offering his antagonist, by a herald, the chance of a second encounter.
      This De Grantmesnil declined, avowing himself vanquished as much by the
      courtesy as by the address of his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph de Vipont summed up the list of the stranger's triumphs, being
      hurled to the ground with such force, that the blood gushed from his nose
      and his mouth, and he was borne senseless from the lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the Prince
      and marshals, announcing that day's honours to the Disinherited Knight.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &mdash;&mdash;In the midst was seen
     A lady of a more majestic mien,
     By stature and by beauty mark'd their sovereign Queen.
</pre>
    <hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And as in beauty she surpass'd the choir,
     So nobler than the rest was her attire;
     A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,
     Plain without pomp, and rich without a show;
     A branch of Agnus Castus in her hand,
     She bore aloft her symbol of command.
     The Flower and the Leaf
</pre>
    <p>
      William de Wyvil and Stephen de Martival, the marshals of the field, were
      the first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying him, at
      the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least, that he
      would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive the prize of the
      day's tourney from the hands of Prince John. The Disinherited Knight, with
      all knightly courtesy, declined their request, alleging, that he could not
      at this time suffer his face to be seen, for reasons which he had assigned
      to the heralds when he entered the lists. The marshals were perfectly
      satisfied by this reply; for amidst the frequent and capricious vows by
      which knights were accustomed to bind themselves in the days of chivalry,
      there were none more common than those by which they engaged to remain
      incognito for a certain space, or until some particular adventure was
      achieved. The marshals, therefore, pressed no farther into the mystery of
      the Disinherited Knight, but, announcing to Prince John the conqueror's
      desire to remain unknown, they requested permission to bring him before
      his Grace, in order that he might receive the reward of his valour.
    </p>
    <p>
      John's curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger; and,
      being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in which the
      challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one knight,
      he answered haughtily to the marshals, &ldquo;By the light of Our Lady's brow,
      this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his courtesy as of his
      lands, since he desires to appear before us without uncovering his face.&mdash;Wot
      ye, my lords,&rdquo; he said, turning round to his train, &ldquo;who this gallant can
      be, that bears himself thus proudly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot guess,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;nor did I think there had been
      within the four seas that girth Britain a champion that could bear down
      these five knights in one day's jousting. By my faith, I shall never
      forget the force with which he shocked De Vipont. The poor Hospitaller was
      hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boast not of that,&rdquo; said a Knight of St John, who was present; &ldquo;your
      Temple champion had no better luck. I saw your brave lance, Bois-Guilbert,
      roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at every turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Bracy, being attached to the Templars, would have replied, but was
      prevented by Prince John. &ldquo;Silence, sirs!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what unprofitable
      debate have we here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The victor,&rdquo; said De Wyvil, &ldquo;still waits the pleasure of your highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our pleasure,&rdquo; answered John, &ldquo;that he do so wait until we learn
      whether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and
      quality. Should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough to
      keep him warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; said Waldemar Fitzurse, &ldquo;will do less than due honour to the
      victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that which we
      cannot know; at least I can form no guess&mdash;unless he be one of the
      good lances who accompanied King Richard to Palestine, and who are now
      straggling homeward from the Holy Land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be the Earl of Salisbury,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;he is about the same
      pitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Thomas de Multon, the Knight of Gilsland, rather,&rdquo; said Fitzurse;
      &ldquo;Salisbury is bigger in the bones.&rdquo; A whisper arose among the train, but
      by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. &ldquo;It might be the King&mdash;it
      might be Richard Coeur-de-Lion himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over God's forbode!&rdquo; said Prince John, involuntarily turning at the same
      time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of
      lightning; &ldquo;Waldemar!&mdash;De Bracy! brave knights and gentlemen,
      remember your promises, and stand truly by me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is no danger impending,&rdquo; said Waldemar Fitzurse; &ldquo;are you so little
      acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your father's son, as to think they
      can be held within the circumference of yonder suit of armour?&mdash;De
      Wyvil and Martival, you will best serve the Prince by bringing forward the
      victor to the throne, and ending an error that has conjured all the blood
      from his cheeks.&mdash;Look at him more closely,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;your
      highness will see that he wants three inches of King Richard's height, and
      twice as much of his shoulder-breadth. The very horse he backs, could not
      have carried the ponderous weight of King Richard through a single
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the Disinherited
      Knight to the foot of a wooden flight of steps, which formed the ascent
      from the lists to Prince John's throne. Still discomposed with the idea
      that his brother, so much injured, and to whom he was so much indebted,
      had suddenly arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions pointed
      out by Fitzurse did not altogether remove the Prince's apprehensions; and
      while, with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his valour, he caused to
      be delivered to him the war-horse assigned as the prize, he trembled lest
      from the barred visor of the mailed form before him, an answer might be
      returned, in the deep and awful accents of Richard the Lion-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Disinherited Knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment of
      the Prince, which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the animal
      itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture; which,
      however, scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the eyes of
      those who were judges. Laying one hand upon the pommel of the saddle, the
      Disinherited Knight vaulted at once upon the back of the steed without
      making use of the stirrup, and, brandishing aloft his lance, rode twice
      around the lists, exhibiting the points and paces of the horse with the
      skill of a perfect horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of vanity, which might otherwise have been attributed to
      this display, was removed by the propriety shown in exhibiting to the best
      advantage the princely reward with which he had been just honoured, and
      the Knight was again greeted by the acclamations of all present.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the bustling Prior of Jorvaulx had reminded Prince John,
      in a whisper, that the victor must now display his good judgment, instead
      of his valour, by selecting from among the beauties who graced the
      galleries a lady, who should fill the throne of the Queen of Beauty and of
      Love, and deliver the prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day. The
      Prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon, as the Knight passed
      him in his second career around the lists. The Knight turned towards the
      throne, and, sinking his lance, until the point was within a foot of the
      ground, remained motionless, as if expecting John's commands; while all
      admired the sudden dexterity with which he instantly reduced his fiery
      steed from a state of violent emotion and high excitation to the stillness
      of an equestrian statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;since that is the only title
      by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as privilege, to
      name the fair lady, who, as Queen of Honour and of Love, is to preside
      over next day's festival. If, as a stranger in our land, you should
      require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we can only say that
      Alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight Waldemar Fitzurse, has at our
      court been long held the first in beauty as in place. Nevertheless, it is
      your undoubted prerogative to confer on whom you please this crown, by the
      delivery of which to the lady of your choice, the election of to-morrow's
      Queen will be formal and complete.&mdash;Raise your lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight obeyed; and Prince John placed upon its point a coronet of
      green satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, the upper edge of
      which was relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed interchangeably, like
      the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducal crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of Waldemar
      Fitzurse, John had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind,
      which was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low
      artifice and cunning. He wished to banish from the minds of the chivalry
      around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the Jewess
      Rebecca; he was desirous of conciliating Alicia's father Waldemar, of whom
      he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself dissatisfied
      during the course of the day's proceedings. He had also a wish to
      establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for John was at least as
      licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition. But besides all
      these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against the Disinherited Knight
      (towards whom he already entertained a strong dislike) a powerful enemy in
      the person of Waldemar Fitzurse, who was likely, he thought, highly to
      resent the injury done to his daughter, in case, as was not unlikely, the
      victor should make another choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so indeed it proved. For the Disinherited Knight passed the gallery
      close to that of the Prince, in which the Lady Alicia was seated in the
      full pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he had
      hitherto rode swiftly around the lists, he seemed to exercise his right of
      examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who
      underwent this examination, during the time it was proceeding. Some
      blushed, some assumed an air of pride and dignity, some looked straight
      forward, and essayed to seem utterly unconscious of what was going on,
      some drew back in alarm, which was perhaps affected, some endeavoured to
      forbear smiling, and there were two or three who laughed outright. There
      were also some who dropped their veils over their charms; but, as the
      Wardour Manuscript says these were fair ones of ten years standing, it may
      be supposed that, having had their full share of such vanities, they were
      willing to withdraw their claim, in order to give a fair chance to the
      rising beauties of the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the Lady Rowena
      was placed, and the expectation of the spectators was excited to the
      utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could have
      bribed the Disinherited Knight, the part of the lists before which he
      paused had merited his predilection. Cedric the Saxon, overjoyed at the
      discomfiture of the Templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of his
      two malevolent neighbours, Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, had, with his
      body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each
      course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. The
      Lady Rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention,
      though without openly betraying the same intense interest. Even the
      unmoved Athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when,
      calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health of the
      Disinherited Knight. Another group, stationed under the gallery occupied
      by the Saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Abraham!&rdquo; said Isaac of York, when the first course was run
      betwixt the Templar and the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;how fiercely that
      Gentile rides! Ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way from
      Barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild ass's colt&mdash;and
      the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to Joseph Pareira, the
      armourer of Milan, besides seventy in the hundred of profits, he cares for
      it as little as if he had found it in the highways!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he risks his own person and limbs, father,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;in doing
      such a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare his horse and
      armour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child!&rdquo; replied Isaac, somewhat heated, &ldquo;thou knowest not what thou
      speakest&mdash;His neck and limbs are his own, but his horse and armour
      belong to&mdash;Holy Jacob! what was I about to say!&mdash;Nevertheless,
      it is a good youth&mdash;See, Rebecca! see, he is again about to go up to
      battle against the Philistine&mdash;Pray, child&mdash;pray for the safety
      of the good youth,&mdash;and of the speedy horse, and the rich armour.&mdash;God
      of my fathers!&rdquo; he again exclaimed, &ldquo;he hath conquered, and the
      uncircumcised Philistine hath fallen before his lance,&mdash;even as Og
      the King of Bashan, and Sihon, King of the Amorites, fell before the sword
      of our fathers!&mdash;Surely he shall take their gold and their silver,
      and their war-horses, and their armour of brass and of steel, for a prey
      and for a spoil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same anxiety did the worthy Jew display during every course that was
      run, seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the value of
      the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each new
      success. There had been therefore no small interest taken in the success
      of the Disinherited Knight, by those who occupied the part of the lists
      before which he now paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the champion
      of the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while the eyes of
      the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then, gradually and
      gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited the coronet which
      it supported at the feet of the fair Rowena. The trumpets instantly
      sounded, while the heralds proclaimed the Lady Rowena the Queen of Beauty
      and of Love for the ensuing day, menacing with suitable penalties those
      who should be disobedient to her authority. They then repeated their cry
      of Largesse, to which Cedric, in the height of his joy, replied by an
      ample donative, and to which Athelstane, though less promptly, added one
      equally large.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some murmuring among the damsels of Norman descent, who were as
      much unused to see the preference given to a Saxon beauty, as the Norman
      nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they
      themselves had introduced. But these sounds of disaffection were drowned
      by the popular shout of &ldquo;Long live the Lady Rowena, the chosen and lawful
      Queen of Love and of Beauty!&rdquo; To which many in the lower area added, &ldquo;Long
      live the Saxon Princess! long live the race of the immortal Alfred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However unacceptable these sounds might be to Prince John, and to those
      around him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the nomination
      of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left his throne; and
      mounting his jennet, accompanied by his train, he again entered the lists.
      The Prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of the Lady Alicia, to whom
      he paid his compliments, observing, at the same time, to those around him&mdash;&ldquo;By
      my halidome, sirs! if the Knight's feats in arms have shown that he hath
      limbs and sinews, his choice hath no less proved that his eyes are none of
      the clearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on this occasion, as during his whole life, John's misfortune, not
      perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to
      conciliate. Waldemar Fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the
      Prince stating thus broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been
      slighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no right of chivalry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;more precious or inalienable than
      that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own judgment. My
      daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own character, and in
      her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full proportion of that
      which is her due.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent to
      his vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where Rowena
      was seated, with the crown still at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assume,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which none
      vows homage more sincerely than ourself, John of Anjou; and if it please
      you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our banquet in the
      Castle of Ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to whose service we
      devote to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowena remained silent, and Cedric answered for her in his native Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;possesses not the language in which to reply
      to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. I also, and the
      noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh, speak only the language, and practise
      only the manners, of our fathers. We therefore decline with thanks your
      Highness's courteous invitation to the banquet. To-morrow, the Lady Rowena
      will take upon her the state to which she has been called by the free
      election of the victor Knight, confirmed by the acclamations of the
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon Rowena's head, in
      token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What says he?&rdquo; said Prince John, affecting not to understand the Saxon
      language, in which, however, he was well skilled. The purport of Cedric's
      speech was repeated to him in French. &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;to-morrow we
      will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her seat of dignity.&mdash;You,
      at least, Sir Knight,&rdquo; he added, turning to the victor, who had remained
      near the gallery, &ldquo;will this day share our banquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight, speaking for the first time, in a low and hurried voice,
      excused himself by pleading fatigue, and the necessity of preparing for
      to-morrow's encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Prince John, haughtily; &ldquo;although unused to such
      refusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may, though
      ungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected Queen of Beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train, and
      his turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for the breaking up
      and dispersion of the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially when
      combined with conscious want of desert, John had hardly proceeded three
      paces, ere again, turning around, he fixed an eye of stern resentment upon
      the yeoman who had displeased him in the early part of the day, and issued
      his commands to the men-at-arms who stood near&mdash;&ldquo;On your life, suffer
      not that fellow to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yeoman stood the angry glance of the Prince with the same unvaried
      steadiness which had marked his former deportment, saying, with a smile,
      &ldquo;I have no intention to leave Ashby until the day after to-morrow&mdash;I
      must see how Staffordshire and Leicestershire can draw their bows&mdash;the
      forests of Needwood and Charnwood must rear good archers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Prince John to his attendants, but not in direct reply,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless his skill
      should prove some apology for his insolence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is full time,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;that the 'outrecuidance' <a
      href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19"><small>19</small></a>
      of these peasants should be restrained by some striking example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar Fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the
      readiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent.
      Prince John resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of the
      multitude became general.
    </p>
    <p>
      In various routes, according to the different quarters from which they
      came, and in groups of various numbers, the spectators were seen retiring
      over the plain. By far the most numerous part streamed towards the town of
      Ashby, where many of the distinguished persons were lodged in the castle,
      and where others found accommodation in the town itself. Among these were
      most of the knights who had already appeared in the tournament, or who
      proposed to fight there the ensuing day, and who, as they rode slowly
      along, talking over the events of the day, were greeted with loud shouts
      by the populace. The same acclamations were bestowed upon Prince John,
      although he was indebted for them rather to the splendour of his
      appearance and train, than to the popularity of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited acclamation,
      attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdraw himself from
      popular notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of those pavilions
      pitched at the extremities of the lists, the use of which was courteously
      tendered him by the marshals of the field. On his retiring to his tent,
      many who had lingered in the lists, to look upon and form conjectures
      concerning him, also dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded
      together in one place, and agitated by the same passing events, were now
      exchanged for the distant hum of voices of different groups retreating in
      all directions, and these speedily died away in silence. No other sounds
      were heard save the voices of the menials who stripped the galleries of
      their cushions and tapestry, in order to put them in safety for the night,
      and wrangled among themselves for the half-used bottles of wine and relics
      of the refreshment which had been served round to the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected; and
      these now began to glimmer through the twilight, announcing the toil of
      the armourers, which was to continue through the whole night, in order to
      repair or alter the suits of armour to be used again on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to two
      hours, surrounded the lists, and kept watch during the night.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Thus, like the sad presaging raven, that tolls
     The sick man's passport in her hollow beak,
     And in the shadow of the silent night

    <p>
      The Disinherited Knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires
      and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him, to bring
      fresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. Their zeal on
      this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since every one desired
      to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet had
      refused, even at the command of Prince John, to lift his visor or to name
      his name. But their officious inquisitiveness was not gratified. The
      Disinherited Knight refused all other assistance save that of his own
      squire, or rather yeoman&mdash;a clownish-looking man, who, wrapt in a
      cloak of dark-coloured felt, and having his head and face half-buried in a
      Norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect the incognito as much as
      his master. All others being excluded from the tent, this attendant
      relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his armour, and
      placed food and wine before him, which the exertions of the day rendered
      very acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced to
      him that five men, each leading a barbed steed, desired to speak with him.
      The Disinherited Knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe usually
      worn by those of his condition, which, being furnished with a hood,
      concealed the features, when such was the pleasure of the wearer, almost
      as completely as the visor of the helmet itself, but the twilight, which
      was now fast darkening, would of itself have rendered a disguise
      unnecessary, unless to persons to whom the face of an individual chanced
      to be particularly well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Disinherited Knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of his
      tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers, whom he
      easily knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led his
      master's charger, loaded with the armour in which he had that day fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to the laws of chivalry,&rdquo; said the foremost of these men, &ldquo;I,
      Baldwin de Oyley, squire to the redoubted Knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
      make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the Disinherited
      Knight, of the horse and armour used by the said Brian de Bois-Guilbert in
      this day's Passage of Arms, leaving it with your nobleness to retain or to
      ransom the same, according to your pleasure; for such is the law of arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to
      await the decision of the Disinherited Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you four, sirs,&rdquo; replied the Knight, addressing those who had last
      spoken, &ldquo;and to your honourable and valiant masters, I have one common
      reply. Commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, I should do
      ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by braver
      cavaliers.&mdash;I would I could here end my message to these gallant
      knights; but being, as I term myself, in truth and earnest, the
      Disinherited, I must be thus far bound to your masters, that they will, of
      their courtesy, be pleased to ransom their steeds and armour, since that
      which I wear I can hardly term mine own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We stand commissioned, each of us,&rdquo; answered the squire of Reginald
      Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;to offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these horses and
      suits of armour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sufficient,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight. &ldquo;Half the sum my present
      necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half, distribute one
      moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the other half betwixt
      the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels, and attendants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep
      sense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a
      scale so extensive. The Disinherited Knight then addressed his discourse
      to Baldwin, the squire of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;From your master,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;I will accept neither arms nor ransom. Say to him in my name, that
      our strife is not ended&mdash;no, not till we have fought as well with
      swords as with lances&mdash;as well on foot as on horseback. To this
      mortal quarrel he has himself defied me, and I shall not forget the
      challenge.&mdash;Meantime, let him be assured, that I hold him not as one
      of his companions, with whom I can with pleasure exchange courtesies; but
      rather as one with whom I stand upon terms of mortal defiance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master,&rdquo; answered Baldwin, &ldquo;knows how to requite scorn with scorn, and
      blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy. Since you disdain to
      accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have rated the arms
      of the other knights, I must leave his armour and his horse here, being
      well assured that he will never deign to mount the one nor wear the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have spoken well, good squire,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;well
      and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent master.
      Leave not, however, the horse and armour here. Restore them to thy master;
      or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good friend, for thine own
      use. So far as they are mine, I bestow them upon you freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the
      Disinherited Knight entered the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus far, Gurth,&rdquo; said he, addressing his attendant, &ldquo;the reputation of
      English chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;for a Saxon swineherd, have not ill played the
      personage of a Norman squire-at-arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, but,&rdquo; answered the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;thou hast ever kept me in
      anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;I fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow,
      Wamba the Jester, of whom I could never discover whether he were most
      knave or fool. Yet I could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master
      passed so near to me, dreaming all the while that Gurth was keeping his
      porkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of Rotherwood. If I am
      discovered&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said the Disinherited Knight, &ldquo;thou knowest my promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, for that matter,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;I will never fail my friend for fear
      of my skin-cutting. I have a tough hide, that will bear knife or scourge
      as well as any boar's hide in my herd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, I will requite the risk you run for my love, Gurth,&rdquo; said the
      Knight. &ldquo;Meanwhile, I pray you to accept these ten pieces of gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am richer,&rdquo; said Gurth, putting them into his pouch, &ldquo;than ever was
      swineherd or bondsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this bag of gold to Ashby,&rdquo; continued his master, &ldquo;and find out
      Isaac the Jew of York, and let him pay himself for the horse and arms with
      which his credit supplied me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, by St Dunstan,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;that I will not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, knave,&rdquo; replied his master, &ldquo;wilt thou not obey my commands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands,&rdquo; replied Gurth;
      &ldquo;but this is none of these. To suffer the Jew to pay himself would be
      dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it
      were the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering a
      believer to enrich an infidel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,&rdquo; said the Disinherited
      Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said Gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and leaving
      the apartment; &ldquo;and it will go hard,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but I content him with
      one-half of his own asking.&rdquo; So saying, he departed, and left the
      Disinherited Knight to his own perplexed ruminations; which, upon more
      accounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader, were of a
      nature peculiarly agitating and painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now change the scene to the village of Ashby, or rather to a
      country house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy Israelite, with whom
      Isaac, his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the Jews,
      it is well known, being as liberal in exercising the duties of hospitality
      and charity among their own people, as they were alleged to be reluctant
      and churlish in extending them to those whom they termed Gentiles, and
      whose treatment of them certainly merited little hospitality at their
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of an
      Oriental taste, Rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered cushions,
      which, piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber, served,
      like the estrada of the Spaniards, instead of chairs and stools. She was
      watching the motions of her father with a look of anxious and filial
      affection, while he paced the apartment with a dejected mien and
      disordered step; sometimes clasping his hands together&mdash;sometimes
      casting his eyes to the roof of the apartment, as one who laboured under
      great mental tribulation. &ldquo;O, Jacob!&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;O, all ye twelve
      Holy Fathers of our tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who hath
      duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of Moses&mdash;Fifty zecchins
      wrenched from me at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;you seemed to give the gold to Prince John
      willingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly? the blotch of Egypt upon him!&mdash;Willingly, saidst thou?&mdash;Ay,
      as willingly as when, in the Gulf of Lyons, I flung over my merchandise to
      lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest&mdash;robed the
      seething billows in my choice silks&mdash;perfumed their briny foam with
      myrrh and aloes&mdash;enriched their caverns with gold and silver work!
      And was not that an hour of unutterable misery, though my own hands made
      the sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was a sacrifice which Heaven exacted to save our lives,&rdquo; answered
      Rebecca, &ldquo;and the God of our fathers has since blessed your store and your
      gettings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered Isaac, &ldquo;but if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did
      to-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?&mdash;O, daughter,
      disinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls our
      race is, that when we are wronged and plundered, all the world laughs
      around, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to smile
      tamely, when we would revenge bravely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not thus of it, my father,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;we also have advantages.
      These Gentiles, cruel and oppressive as they are, are in some sort
      dependent on the dispersed children of Zion, whom they despise and
      persecute. Without the aid of our wealth, they could neither furnish forth
      their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace, and the gold which we
      lend them returns with increase to our coffers. We are like the herb which
      flourisheth most when it is most trampled on. Even this day's pageant had
      not proceeded without the consent of the despised Jew, who furnished the
      means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;thou hast harped upon another string of sorrow.
      The goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the full profit of my
      adventure with our Kirjath Jairam of Leicester&mdash;there is a dead loss
      too&mdash;ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of a week; ay, of the
      space between two Sabbaths&mdash;and yet it may end better than I now
      think, for 'tis a good youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;you shall not repent you of requiting the good
      deed received of the stranger knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust so, daughter,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;and I trust too in the rebuilding of
      Zion; but as well do I hope with my own bodily eyes to see the walls and
      battlements of the new Temple, as to see a Christian, yea, the very best
      of Christians, repay a debt to a Jew, unless under the awe of the judge
      and jailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and
      Rebecca, perceiving that her attempts at consolation only served to awaken
      new subjects of complaint, wisely desisted from her unavailing efforts&mdash;a
      prudential line of conduct, and we recommend to all who set up for
      comforters and advisers, to follow it in the like circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was now becoming dark, when a Jewish servant entered the
      apartment, and placed upon the table two silver lamps, fed with perfumed
      oil; the richest wines, and the most delicate refreshments, were at the
      same time displayed by another Israelitish domestic on a small ebony
      table, inlaid with silver; for, in the interior of their houses, the Jews
      refused themselves no expensive indulgences. At the same time the servant
      informed Isaac, that a Nazarene (so they termed Christians, while
      conversing among themselves) desired to speak with him. He that would live
      by traffic, must hold himself at the disposal of every one claiming
      business with him. Isaac at once replaced on the table the untasted glass
      of Greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and saying hastily to
      his daughter, &ldquo;Rebecca, veil thyself,&rdquo; commanded the stranger to be
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver
      gauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and Gurth entered, wrapt
      in the ample folds of his Norman mantle. His appearance was rather
      suspicious than prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing his
      bonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou Isaac the Jew of York?&rdquo; said Gurth, in Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Isaac, in the same language, (for his traffic had rendered
      every tongue spoken in Britain familiar to him)&mdash;&ldquo;and who art thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not to the purpose,&rdquo; answered Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as my name is to thee,&rdquo; replied Isaac; &ldquo;for without knowing
      thine, how can I hold intercourse with thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; answered Gurth; &ldquo;I, being to pay money, must know that I deliver
      it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, will not, I think,
      care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;you are come to pay moneys?&mdash;Holy Father Abraham!
      that altereth our relation to each other. And from whom dost thou bring
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;victor in this day's
      tournament. It is the price of the armour supplied to him by Kirjath
      Jairam of Leicester, on thy recommendation. The steed is restored to thy
      stable. I desire to know the amount of the sum which I am to pay for the
      armour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said he was a good youth!&rdquo; exclaimed Isaac with joyful exultation. &ldquo;A
      cup of wine will do thee no harm,&rdquo; he added, filling and handing to the
      swineherd a richer drought than Gurth had ever before tasted. &ldquo;And how
      much money,&rdquo; continued Isaac, &ldquo;has thou brought with thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; said Gurth, setting down the cup, &ldquo;what nectar these
      unbelieving dogs drink, while true Christians are fain to quaff ale as
      muddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!&mdash;What money have I
      brought with me?&rdquo; continued the Saxon, when he had finished this uncivil
      ejaculation, &ldquo;even but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. What,
      Isaac! thou must bear a conscience, though it be a Jewish one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;thy master has won goodly steeds and rich armours
      with the strength of his lance, and of his right hand&mdash;but 'tis a
      good youth&mdash;the Jew will take these in present payment, and render
      him back the surplus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master has disposed of them already,&rdquo; said Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that was wrong,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that was the part of a fool. No
      Christians here could buy so many horses and armour&mdash;no Jew except
      myself would give him half the values. But thou hast a hundred zecchins
      with thee in that bag,&rdquo; said Isaac, prying under Gurth's cloak, &ldquo;it is a
      heavy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heads for cross-bow bolts in it,&rdquo; said Gurth, readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo;&mdash;said Isaac, panting and hesitating between habitual
      love of gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the present instance,
      &ldquo;if I should say that I would take eighty zecchins for the good steed and
      the rich armour, which leaves me not a guilder's profit, have you money to
      pay me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barely,&rdquo; said Gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable than he
      expected, &ldquo;and it will leave my master nigh penniless. Nevertheless, if
      such be your least offer, I must be content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill thyself another goblet of wine,&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;Ah! eighty zecchins
      is too little. It leaveth no profit for the usages of the moneys; and,
      besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this day's encounter.
      O, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! man and steed rushing on each
      other like wild bulls of Bashan! The horse cannot but have had wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;he is sound, wind and limb; and you may see
      him now, in your stable. And I say, over and above, that seventy zecchins
      is enough for the armour, and I hope a Christian's word is as good as a
      Jew's. If you will not take seventy, I will carry this bag&rdquo; (and he shook
      it till the contents jingled) &ldquo;back to my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;lay down the talents&mdash;the shekels&mdash;the
      eighty zecchins, and thou shalt see I will consider thee liberally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth at length complied; and telling out eighty zecchins upon the table,
      the Jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horse and suit of
      armour. The Jew's hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the first seventy
      pieces of gold. The last ten he told over with much deliberation, pausing,
      and saying something as he took each piece from the table, and dropt it
      into his purse. It seemed as if his avarice were struggling with his
      better nature, and compelling him to pouch zecchin after zecchin while his
      generosity urged him to restore some part at least to his benefactor, or
      as a donation to his agent. His whole speech ran nearly thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-one&mdash;seventy-two; thy master is a good youth&mdash;seventy-three,
      an excellent youth&mdash;seventy-four&mdash;that piece hath been clipt
      within the ring&mdash;seventy-five&mdash;and that looketh light of weight&mdash;seventy-six&mdash;when
      thy master wants money, let him come to Isaac of York&mdash;seventy-seven&mdash;that
      is, with reasonable security.&rdquo; Here he made a considerable pause, and
      Gurth had good hope that the last three pieces might escape the fate of
      their comrades; but the enumeration proceeded.&mdash;&ldquo;Seventy-eight&mdash;thou
      art a good fellow&mdash;seventy-nine&mdash;and deservest something for
      thyself&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending,
      doubtless, to bestow it upon Gurth. He weighed it upon the tip of his
      finger, and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. Had it rung too
      flat, or had it felt a hair's breadth too light, generosity had carried
      the day; but, unhappily for Gurth, the chime was full and true, the
      zecchin plump, newly coined, and a grain above weight. Isaac could not
      find in his heart to part with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in
      absence of mind, with the words, &ldquo;Eighty completes the tale, and I trust
      thy master will reward thee handsomely.&mdash;Surely,&rdquo; he added, looking
      earnestly at the bag, &ldquo;thou hast more coins in that pouch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied,
      &ldquo;About the same quantity which thou hast just told over so carefully.&rdquo; He
      then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap, adding,&mdash;&ldquo;Peril
      of thy beard, Jew, see that this be full and ample!&rdquo; He filled himself
      unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that Ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me.
      Nevertheless his master is a good youth&mdash;ay, and I am well pleased
      that he hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the
      speed of his horse and by the strength of his lance, which, like that of
      Goliath the Philistine, might vie with a weaver's beam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he turned to receive Rebecca's answer, he observed, that during his
      chattering with Gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached the
      dark antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discover the entrance,
      when a figure in white, shown by a small silver lamp which she held in her
      hand, beckoned him into a side apartment. Gurth had some reluctance to
      obey the summons. Rough and impetuous as a wild boar, where only earthly
      force was to be apprehended, he had all the characteristic terrors of a
      Saxon respecting fawns, forest-fiends, white women, and the whole of the
      superstitions which his ancestors had brought with them from the wilds of
      Germany. He remembered, moreover, that he was in the house of a Jew, a
      people who, besides the other unamiable qualities which popular report
      ascribed to them, were supposed to be profound necromancers and cabalists.
      Nevertheless, after a moment's pause, he obeyed the beckoning summons of
      the apparition, and followed her into the apartment which she indicated,
      where he found to his joyful surprise that his fair guide was the
      beautiful Jewess whom he had seen at the tournament, and a short time in
      her father's apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked him the particulars of his transaction with Isaac, which he
      detailed accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father did but jest with thee, good fellow,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;he owes
      thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay, were their
      value tenfold. What sum didst thou pay my father even now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty zecchins,&rdquo; said Gurth, surprised at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this purse,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;thou wilt find a hundred. Restore to thy
      master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the remainder. Haste&mdash;begone&mdash;stay
      not to render thanks! and beware how you pass through this crowded town,
      where thou mayst easily lose both thy burden and thy life.&mdash;Reuben,&rdquo;
       she added, clapping her hands together, &ldquo;light forth this stranger, and
      fail not to draw lock and bar behind him.&rdquo; Reuben, a dark-brow'd and
      black-bearded Israelite, obeyed her summons, with a torch in his hand;
      undid the outward door of the house, and conducting Gurth across a paved
      court, let him out through a wicket in the entrance-gate, which he closed
      behind him with such bolts and chains as would well have become that of a
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Dunstan,&rdquo; said Gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue, &ldquo;this is
      no Jewess, but an angel from heaven! Ten zecchins from my brave young
      master&mdash;twenty from this pearl of Zion&mdash;Oh, happy day!&mdash;Such
      another, Gurth, will redeem thy bondage, and make thee a brother as free
      of thy guild as the best. And then do I lay down my swineherd's horn and
      staff, and take the freeman's sword and buckler, and follow my young
      master to the death, without hiding either my face or my name.&rdquo;

     &mdash;Two Gentlemen of Verona
</pre>
    <p>
      The nocturnal adventures of Gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he
      himself became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two
      straggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found
      himself in a deep lane, running between two banks overgrown with hazel and
      holly, while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether across
      the path. The lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the carriages
      which had recently transported articles of various kinds to the
      tournament; and it was dark, for the banks and bushes intercepted the
      light of the harvest moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed
      occasionally with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams, and
      sometimes by wild strains of distant music. All these sounds, intimating
      the disorderly state of the town, crowded with military nobles and their
      dissolute attendants, gave Gurth some uneasiness. &ldquo;The Jewess was right,&rdquo;
       he said to himself. &ldquo;By heaven and St Dunstan, I would I were safe at my
      journey's end with all this treasure! Here are such numbers, I will not
      say of arrant thieves, but of errant knights and errant squires, errant
      monks and errant minstrels, errant jugglers and errant jesters, that a man
      with a single merk would be in danger, much more a poor swineherd with a
      whole bagful of zecchins. Would I were out of the shade of these infernal
      bushes, that I might at least see any of St Nicholas's clerks before they
      spring on my shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common to
      which the lane led, but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his object.
      Just as he had attained the upper end of the lane, where the underwood was
      thickest, four men sprung upon him, even as his fears anticipated, two
      from each side of the road, and seized him so fast, that resistance, if at
      first practicable, would have been now too late.&mdash;&ldquo;Surrender your
      charge,&rdquo; said one of them; &ldquo;we are the deliverers of the commonwealth, who
      ease every man of his burden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not ease me of mine so lightly,&rdquo; muttered Gurth, whose surly
      honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate violence,&mdash;&ldquo;had
      I it but in my power to give three strokes in its defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see that presently,&rdquo; said the robber; and, speaking to his
      companions, he added, &ldquo;bring along the knave. I see he would have his head
      broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been dragged
      somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the lane, found
      himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and the open common.
      He was compelled to follow his rough conductors into the very depth of
      this cover, where they stopt unexpectedly in an irregular open space, free
      in a great measure from trees, and on which, therefore, the beams of the
      moon fell without much interruption from boughs and leaves. Here his
      captors were joined by two other persons, apparently belonging to the
      gang. They had short swords by their sides, and quarter-staves in their
      hands, and Gurth could now observe that all six wore visors, which
      rendered their occupation a matter of no question, even had their former
      proceedings left it in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What money hast thou, churl?&rdquo; said one of the thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty zecchins of my own property,&rdquo; answered Gurth, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A forfeit&mdash;a forfeit,&rdquo; shouted the robbers; &ldquo;a Saxon hath thirty
      zecchins, and returns sober from a village! An undeniable and unredeemable
      forfeit of all he hath about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoarded it to purchase my freedom,&rdquo; said Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art an ass,&rdquo; replied one of the thieves &ldquo;three quarts of double ale
      had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, if he be a
      Saxon like thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sad truth,&rdquo; replied Gurth; &ldquo;but if these same thirty zecchins will buy
      my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and I will pay them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others;
      &ldquo;this bag which thou bearest, as I can feel through thy cloak, contains
      more coin than thou hast told us of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the good knight my master's,&rdquo; answered Gurth, &ldquo;of which, assuredly,
      I would not have spoken a word, had you been satisfied with working your
      will upon mine own property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art an honest fellow,&rdquo; replied the robber, &ldquo;I warrant thee; and we
      worship not St Nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet
      escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. Meantime render up thy trust for a
      time.&rdquo; So saying, he took from Gurth's breast the large leathern pouch, in
      which the purse given him by Rebecca was enclosed, as well as the rest of
      the zecchins, and then continued his interrogation.&mdash;&ldquo;Who is thy
      master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose good lance,&rdquo; replied the robber, &ldquo;won the prize in to-day's
      tourney? What is his name and lineage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his pleasure,&rdquo; answered Gurth, &ldquo;that they be concealed; and from
      me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is thine own name and lineage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell that,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;might reveal my master's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a saucy groom,&rdquo; said the robber, &ldquo;but of that anon. How comes
      thy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by what means hath
      it accrued to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By his good lance,&rdquo; answered Gurth.&mdash;&ldquo;These bags contain the ransom
      of four good horses, and four good suits of armour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is there?&rdquo; demanded the robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred zecchins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two hundred zecchins!&rdquo; said the bandit; &ldquo;your master hath dealt
      liberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. Name those
      who paid the gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The armour and horse of the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, at what
      ransom were they held?&mdash;Thou seest thou canst not deceive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;will take nought from the Templar save his
      life's-blood. They are on terms of mortal defiance, and cannot hold
      courteous intercourse together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated the robber, and paused after he had said the
      word. &ldquo;And what wert thou now doing at Ashby with such a charge in thy
      custody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went thither to render to Isaac the Jew of York,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;the
      price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this
      tournament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much didst thou pay to Isaac?&mdash;Methinks, to judge by weight,
      there is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid to Isaac,&rdquo; said the Saxon, &ldquo;eighty zecchins, and he restored me a
      hundred in lieu thereof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! what!&rdquo; exclaimed all the robbers at once; &ldquo;darest thou trifle with
      us, that thou tellest such improbable lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I tell you,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;is as true as the moon is in heaven. You
      will find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch, and
      separate from the rest of the gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink thee, man,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;thou speakest of a Jew&mdash;of an
      Israelite,&mdash;as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of his deserts
      to return the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no more mercy in them,&rdquo; said another of the banditti, &ldquo;than in
      an unbribed sheriffs officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, however, as I say,&rdquo; said Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike a light instantly,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;I will examine this said
      purse; and if it be as this fellow says, the Jew's bounty is little less
      miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the wilderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine the
      purse. The others crowded around him, and even two who had hold of Gurth
      relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the issue of
      the search. Availing himself of their negligence, by a sudden exertion of
      strength and activity, Gurth shook himself free of their hold, and might
      have escaped, could he have resolved to leave his master's property behind
      him. But such was no part of his intention. He wrenched a quarter-staff
      from one of the fellows, struck down the Captain, who was altogether
      unaware of his purpose, and had well-nigh repossessed himself of the pouch
      and treasure. The thieves, however, were too nimble for him, and again
      secured both the bag and the trusty Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knave!&rdquo; said the Captain, getting up, &ldquo;thou hast broken my head; and with
      other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy insolence. But
      thou shalt know thy fate instantly. First let us speak of thy master; the
      knight's matters must go before the squire's, according to the due order
      of chivalry. Stand thou fast in the meantime&mdash;if thou stir again,
      thou shalt have that will make thee quiet for thy life&mdash;Comrades!&rdquo; he
      then said, addressing his gang, &ldquo;this purse is embroidered with Hebrew
      characters, and I well believe the yeoman's tale is true. The errant
      knight, his master, must needs pass us toll-free. He is too like ourselves
      for us to make booty of him, since dogs should not worry dogs where wolves
      and foxes are to be found in abundance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like us?&rdquo; answered one of the gang; &ldquo;I should like to hear how that is
      made good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thou fool,&rdquo; answered the Captain, &ldquo;is he not poor and disinherited
      as we are?&mdash;Doth he not win his substance at the sword's point as we
      do?&mdash;Hath he not beaten Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, even as we
      would beat them if we could? Is he not the enemy to life and death of
      Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom we have so much reason to fear? And were all
      this otherwise, wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience than an
      unbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that were a shame,&rdquo; muttered the other fellow; &ldquo;and yet, when I
      served in the band of stout old Gandelyn, we had no such scruples of
      conscience. And this insolent peasant,&mdash;he too, I warrant me, is to
      be dismissed scatheless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if THOU canst scathe him,&rdquo; replied the Captain.&mdash;&ldquo;Here, fellow,&rdquo;
       continued he, addressing Gurth, &ldquo;canst thou use the staff, that thou
      starts to it so readily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;thou shouldst be best able to reply to that
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock,&rdquo; replied the Captain; &ldquo;do
      as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free; and if thou dost
      not&mdash;why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, I think I
      must pay thy ransom myself.&mdash;Take thy staff, Miller,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and
      keep thy head; and do you others let the fellow go, and give him a staff&mdash;there
      is light enough to lay on load by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two champions being alike armed with quarter-staves, stepped forward
      into the centre of the open space, in order to have the full benefit of
      the moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and crying to their
      comrade, &ldquo;Miller! beware thy toll-dish.&rdquo; The Miller, on the other hand,
      holding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it flourish round his
      head after the fashion which the French call &ldquo;faire le moulinet&rdquo;,
      exclaimed boastfully, &ldquo;Come on, churl, an thou darest: thou shalt feel the
      strength of a miller's thumb!&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0169m.jpg" style="width:100%;"  alt="0169m "  /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0169.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou be'st a miller,&rdquo; answered Gurth, undauntedly, making his weapon
      play around his head with equal dexterity, &ldquo;thou art doubly a thief, and
      I, as a true man, bid thee defiance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes they
      displayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill, intercepting and
      returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid dexterity,
      while, from the continued clatter of their weapons, a person at a distance
      might have supposed that there were at least six persons engaged on each
      side. Less obstinate, and even less dangerous combats, have been described
      in good heroic verse; but that of Gurth and the Miller must remain unsung,
      for want of a sacred poet to do justice to its eventful progress. Yet,
      though quarter-staff play be out of date, what we can in prose we will do
      for these bold champions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long they fought equally, until the Miller began to lose temper at finding
      himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter of his companions,
      who, as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. This was not a state of
      mind favourable to the noble game of quarter-staff, in which, as in
      ordinary cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite; and it gave
      Gurth, whose temper was steady, though surly, the opportunity of acquiring
      a decided advantage, in availing himself of which he displayed great
      mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of his
      weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staff distance, while
      Gurth defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands about a yard
      asunder, and covering himself by shifting his weapon with great celerity,
      so as to protect his head and body. Thus did he maintain the defensive,
      making his eye, foot, and hand keep true time, until, observing his
      antagonist to lose wind, he darted the staff at his face with his left
      hand; and, as the Miller endeavoured to parry the thrust, he slid his
      right hand down to his left, and with the full swing of the weapon struck
      his opponent on the left side of the head, who instantly measured his
      length upon the green sward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and yeomanly done!&rdquo; shouted the robbers; &ldquo;fair play and Old England
      for ever! The Saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide, and the Miller
      has met his match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou mayst go thy ways, my friend,&rdquo; said the Captain, addressing Gurth,
      in special confirmation of the general voice, &ldquo;and I will cause two of my
      comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy master's pavilion, and to
      guard thee from night-walkers that might have less tender consciences than
      ours; for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a night as
      this. Take heed, however,&rdquo; he added sternly; &ldquo;remember thou hast refused
      to tell thy name&mdash;ask not after ours, nor endeavour to discover who
      or what we are; for, if thou makest such an attempt, thou wilt come by
      worse fortune than has yet befallen thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gurth thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to his
      recommendation. Two of the outlaws, taking up their quarter-staves, and
      desiring Gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward along a
      by-path, which traversed the thicket and the broken ground adjacent to it.
      On the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his conductors, and
      receiving an answer in a whisper, withdrew into the wood, and suffered
      them to pass unmolested. This circumstance induced Gurth to believe both
      that the gang was strong in numbers, and that they kept regular guards
      around their place of rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived on the open heath, where Gurth might have had some
      trouble in finding his road, the thieves guided him straight forward to
      the top of a little eminence, whence he could see, spread beneath him in
      the moonlight, the palisades of the lists, the glimmering pavilions
      pitched at either end, with the pennons which adorned them fluttering in
      the moonbeams, and from which could be heard the hum of the song with
      which the sentinels were beguiling their night-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the thieves stopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We go with you no farther,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;it were not safe that we should
      do so.&mdash;Remember the warning you have received&mdash;keep secret what
      has this night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent it&mdash;neglect
      what is now told you, and the Tower of London shall not protect you
      against our revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night to you, kind sirs,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;I shall remember your orders,
      and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an honester
      trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence they
      had come, and Gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom,
      notwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the whole
      adventures of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Disinherited Knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the
      generosity of Rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not profit,
      than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality seemed
      totally foreign. His course of reflections upon these singular
      circumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking
      repose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety of
      refreshing himself for the morrow's encounter, rendered alike
      indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch with
      which the tent was provided; and the faithful Gurth, extending his hardy
      limbs upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the pavilion, laid
      himself across the opening of the tent, so that no one could enter without
      awakening him.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The heralds left their pricking up and down,
     Now ringen trumpets loud and clarion.
     There is no more to say, but east and west,
     In go the speares sadly in the rest,
     In goth the sharp spur into the side,
     There see men who can just and who can ride;
     There shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick,
     He feeleth through the heart-spone the prick;
     Up springen speares, twenty feet in height,
     Out go the swordes to the silver bright;
     The helms they to-hewn and to-shred;
     Out burst the blood with stern streames red.
     Chaucer.
</pre>
    <p>
      Morning arose in unclouded splendour, and ere the sun was much above the
      horizon, the idlest or the most eager of the spectators appeared on the
      common, moving to the lists as to a general centre, in order to secure a
      favourable situation for viewing the continuation of the expected games.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together
      with the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights
      who intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. This was
      a necessary precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two bodies
      who should be opposed to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to due formality, the Disinherited Knight was to be considered
      as leader of the one body, while Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had been
      rated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was named first
      champion of the other band. Those who had concurred in the challenge
      adhered to his party of course, excepting only Ralph de Vipont, whom his
      fall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour. There was no want of
      distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the ranks on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, although the general tournament, in which all knights fought at
      once, was more dangerous than single encounters, they were, nevertheless,
      more frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age. Many knights,
      who had not sufficient confidence in their own skill to defy a single
      adversary of high reputation, were, nevertheless, desirous of displaying
      their valour in the general combat, where they might meet others with whom
      they were more upon an equality. On the present occasion, about fifty
      knights were inscribed as desirous of combating upon each side, when the
      marshals declared that no more could be admitted, to the disappointment of
      several who were too late in preferring their claim to be included.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the hour of ten o'clock, the whole plain was crowded with horsemen,
      horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament; and shortly
      after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced Prince John and his retinue,
      attended by many of those knights who meant to take share in the game, as
      well as others who had no such intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time arrived Cedric the Saxon, with the Lady Rowena,
      unattended, however, by Athelstane. This Saxon lord had arrayed his tall
      and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the
      combatants; and, considerably to the surprise of Cedric, had chosen to
      enlist himself on the part of the Knight Templar. The Saxon, indeed, had
      remonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice he had
      made of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer usually
      given by those who are more obstinate in following their own course, than
      strong in justifying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, Athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself. Though his
      apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend himself
      to the Lady Rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means insensible to her
      charms, and considered his union with her as a matter already fixed beyond
      doubt, by the assent of Cedric and her other friends. It had therefore
      been with smothered displeasure that the proud though indolent Lord of
      Coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day select Rowena as the
      object of that honour which it became his privilege to confer. In order to
      punish him for a preference which seemed to interfere with his own suit,
      Athelstane, confident of his strength, and to whom his flatterers, at
      least, ascribed great skill in arms, had determined not only to deprive
      the Disinherited Knight of his powerful succour, but, if an opportunity
      should occur, to make him feel the weight of his battle-axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Bracy, and other knights attached to Prince John, in obedience to a
      hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, John being
      desirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. On the other
      hand, many other knights, both English and Norman, natives and strangers,
      took part against the challengers, the more readily that the opposite band
      was to be led by so distinguished a champion as the Disinherited Knight
      had approved himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Prince John observed that the destined Queen of the day had
      arrived upon the field, assuming that air of courtesy which sat well upon
      him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet her, doffed
      his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse, assisted the Lady Rowena from
      her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same time, and one of the
      most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thus,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;that we set the dutiful example of
      loyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves her guide to
      the throne which she must this day occupy.&mdash;Ladies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;attend
      your Queen, as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like honours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the Prince marshalled Rowena to the seat of honour opposite his
      own, while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present crowded after
      her to obtain places as near as possible to their temporary sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was Rowena seated, than a burst of music, half-drowned by the
      shouts of the multitude, greeted her new dignity. Meantime, the sun shone
      fierce and bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either side,
      who crowded the opposite extremities of the lists, and held eager
      conference together concerning the best mode of arranging their line of
      battle, and supporting the conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney should
      be rehearsed. These were calculated in some degree to abate the dangers of
      the day; a precaution the more necessary, as the conflict was to be
      maintained with sharp swords and pointed lances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword, and were
      confined to striking. A knight, it was announced, might use a mace or
      battle-axe at pleasure, but the dagger was a prohibited weapon. A knight
      unhorsed might renew the fight on foot with any other on the opposite side
      in the same predicament; but mounted horsemen were in that case forbidden
      to assail him. When any knight could force his antagonist to the extremity
      of the lists, so as to touch the palisade with his person or arms, such
      opponent was obliged to yield himself vanquished, and his armour and horse
      were placed at the disposal of the conqueror. A knight thus overcome was
      not permitted to take farther share in the combat. If any combatant was
      struck down, and unable to recover his feet, his squire or page might
      enter the lists, and drag his master out of the press; but in that case
      the knight was adjudged vanquished, and his arms and horse declared
      forfeited. The combat was to cease as soon as Prince John should throw
      down his leading staff, or truncheon; another precaution usually taken to
      prevent the unnecessary effusion of blood by the too long endurance of a
      sport so desperate. Any knight breaking the rules of the tournament, or
      otherwise transgressing the rules of honourable chivalry, was liable to be
      stript of his arms, and, having his shield reversed to be placed in that
      posture astride upon the bars of the palisade, and exposed to public
      derision, in punishment of his unknightly conduct. Having announced these
      precautions, the heralds concluded with an exhortation to each good knight
      to do his duty, and to merit favour from the Queen of Beauty and of Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proclamation having been made, the heralds withdrew to their
      stations. The knights, entering at either end of the lists in long
      procession, arranged themselves in a double file, precisely opposite to
      each other, the leader of each party being in the centre of the foremost
      rank, a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully marshalled
      the ranks of his party, and stationed every one in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a goodly, and at the same time an anxious, sight, to behold so many
      gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly, stand ready prepared
      for an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles like so many
      pillars of iron, and awaiting the signal of encounter with the same ardour
      as their generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing the ground, gave
      signal of their impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet the knights held their long lances upright, their bright points
      glancing to the sun, and the streamers with which they were decorated
      fluttering over the plumage of the helmets. Thus they remained while the
      marshals of the field surveyed their ranks with the utmost exactness, lest
      either party had more or fewer than the appointed number. The tale was
      found exactly complete. The marshals then withdrew from the lists, and
      William de Wyvil, with a voice of thunder, pronounced the signal words&mdash;&ldquo;Laissez
      aller!&rdquo; The trumpets sounded as he spoke&mdash;the spears of the champions
      were at once lowered and placed in the rests&mdash;the spurs were dashed
      into the flanks of the horses, and the two foremost ranks of either party
      rushed upon each other in full gallop, and met in the middle of the lists
      with a shock, the sound of which was heard at a mile's distance. The rear
      rank of each party advanced at a slower pace to sustain the defeated, and
      follow up the success of the victors of their party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen, for the dust
      raised by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air, and it was a
      minute ere the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter. When
      the fight became visible, half the knights on each side were dismounted,
      some by the dexterity of their adversary's lance,&mdash;some by the
      superior weight and strength of opponents, which had borne down both horse
      and man,&mdash;some lay stretched on earth as if never more to rise,&mdash;some
      had already gained their feet, and were closing hand to hand with those of
      their antagonists who were in the same predicament,&mdash;and several on
      both sides, who had received wounds by which they were disabled, were
      stopping their blood by their scarfs, and endeavouring to extricate
      themselves from the tumult. The mounted knights, whose lances had been
      almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were now closely engaged
      with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and exchanging buffets, as if
      honour and life depended on the issue of the combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank on
      either side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their
      companions. The followers of Brian de Bois-Guilbert shouted&mdash;&ldquo;Ha!
      Beau-seant! Beau-seant! <a href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20"       id="linknoteref-20"><small>20</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;For the Temple&mdash;For the Temple!&rdquo; The opposite party shouted
      in answer&mdash;&ldquo;Desdichado! Desdichado!&rdquo;&mdash;which watch-word they took
      from the motto upon their leader's shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      The champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury, and with
      alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward the
      southern, now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the one or
      the other party prevailed. Meantime the clang of the blows, and the shouts
      of the combatants, mixed fearfully with the sound of the trumpets, and
      drowned the groans of those who fell, and lay rolling defenceless beneath
      the feet of the horses. The splendid armour of the combatants was now
      defaced with dust and blood, and gave way at every stroke of the sword and
      battle-axe. The gay plumage, shorn from the crests, drifted upon the
      breeze like snow-flakes. All that was beautiful and graceful in the
      martial array had disappeared, and what was now visible was only
      calculated to awake terror or compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet such is the force of habit, that not only the vulgar spectators, who
      are naturally attracted by sights of horror, but even the ladies of
      distinction who crowded the galleries, saw the conflict with a thrilling
      interest certainly, but without a wish to withdraw their eyes from a sight
      so terrible. Here and there, indeed, a fair cheek might turn pale, or a
      faint scream might be heard, as a lover, a brother, or a husband, was
      struck from his horse. But, in general, the ladies around encouraged the
      combatants, not only by clapping their hands and waving their veils and
      kerchiefs, but even by exclaiming, &ldquo;Brave lance! Good sword!&rdquo; when any
      successful thrust or blow took place under their observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game, that of
      the men is the more easily understood. It showed itself in loud
      acclamations upon every change of fortune, while all eyes were so riveted
      on the lists, that the spectators seemed as if they themselves had dealt
      and received the blows which were there so freely bestowed. And between
      every pause was heard the voice of the heralds, exclaiming, &ldquo;Fight on,
      brave knights! Man dies, but glory lives!&mdash;Fight on&mdash;death is
      better than defeat!&mdash;Fight on, brave knights!&mdash;for bright eyes
      behold your deeds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to
      discover the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thick of the
      fight, encouraged their companions both by voice and example. Both
      displayed great feats of gallantry, nor did either Bois-Guilbert or the
      Disinherited Knight find in the ranks opposed to them a champion who could
      be termed their unquestioned match. They repeatedly endeavoured to single
      out each other, spurred by mutual animosity, and aware that the fall of
      either leader might be considered as decisive of victory. Such, however,
      was the crowd and confusion, that, during the earlier part of the
      conflict, their efforts to meet were unavailing, and they were repeatedly
      separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of whom was anxious to
      win honour, by measuring his strength against the leader of the opposite
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had
      yielded themselves vanquished, had been compelled to the extremity of the
      lists, or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the strife, the
      Templar and the Disinherited Knight at length encountered hand to hand,
      with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to rivalry of honour,
      could inspire. Such was the address of each in parrying and striking, that
      the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and involuntary shout,
      expressive of their delight and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment the party of the Disinherited Knight had the worst; the
      gigantic arm of Front-de-Boeuf on the one flank, and the ponderous
      strength of Athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing those
      immediately exposed to them. Finding themselves freed from their immediate
      antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights at the same
      instant, that they would render the most decisive advantage to their
      party, by aiding the Templar in his contest with his rival. Turning their
      horses, therefore, at the same moment, the Norman spurred against the
      Disinherited Knight on the one side, and the Saxon on the other. It was
      utterly impossible that the object of this unequal and unexpected assault
      could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a general cry from the
      spectators, who could not but take interest in one exposed to such
      disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware! beware! Sir Disinherited!&rdquo; was shouted so universally, that the
      knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the
      Templar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape the
      charge of Athelstane and Front-de-Boeuf. These knights, therefore, their
      aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the object of
      their attack and the Templar, almost running their horses against each
      other ere they could stop their career. Recovering their horses however,
      and wheeling them round, the whole three pursued their united purpose of
      bearing to the earth the Disinherited Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and activity
      of the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stood him in the more stead, as the horse of Bois-Guilbert was
      wounded, and those of Front-de-Boeuf and Athelstane were both tired with
      the weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with
      the preceding exertions of the day. The masterly horsemanship of the
      Disinherited Knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he
      mounted, enabled him for a few minutes to keep at sword's point his three
      antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon the
      wing, keeping his enemies as far separate as he could, and rushing now
      against the one, now against the other, dealing sweeping blows with his
      sword, without waiting to receive those which were aimed at him in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it was
      evident that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around Prince
      John implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to save so
      brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, by the light of Heaven!&rdquo; answered Prince John; &ldquo;this same
      springald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered hospitality,
      hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to let others have their
      turn.&rdquo; As he spoke thus, an unexpected incident changed the fortune of the
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was among the ranks of the Disinherited Knight a champion in black
      armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall, and to all
      appearance powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted.
      This knight, who bore on his shield no device of any kind, had hitherto
      evinced very little interest in the event of the fight, beating off with
      seeming ease those combatants who attacked him, but neither pursuing his
      advantages, nor himself assailing any one. In short, he had hitherto acted
      the part rather of a spectator than of a party in the tournament, a
      circumstance which procured him among the spectators the name of &ldquo;Le Noir
      Faineant&rdquo;, or the Black Sluggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he discovered
      the leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spurs to his horse,
      which was quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a thunderbolt,
      exclaiming, in a voice like a trumpet-call, &ldquo;Desdichado, to the rescue!&rdquo;
       It was high time; for, while the Disinherited Knight was pressing upon the
      Templar, Front-de-Boeuf had got nigh to him with his uplifted sword; but
      ere the blow could descend, the Sable Knight dealt a stroke on his head,
      which, glancing from the polished helmet, lighted with violence scarcely
      abated on the &ldquo;chamfron&rdquo; of the steed, and Front-de-Boeuf rolled on the
      ground, both horse and man equally stunned by the fury of the blow. &ldquo;Le
      Noir Faineant&rdquo; then turned his horse upon Athelstane of Coningsburgh; and
      his own sword having been broken in his encounter with Front-de-Boeuf, he
      wrenched from the hand of the bulky Saxon the battle-axe which he wielded,
      and, like one familiar with the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a
      blow upon the crest, that Athelstane also lay senseless on the field.
      Having achieved this double feat, for which he was the more highly
      applauded that it was totally unexpected from him, the knight seemed to
      resume the sluggishness of his character, returning calmly to the northern
      extremity of the lists, leaving his leader to cope as he best could with
      Brian de Bois-Guilbert. This was no longer matter of so much difficulty as
      formerly. The Templars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock
      of the Disinherited Knight's charge. Brian de Bois-Guilbert rolled on the
      field, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his
      foot. His antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his fatal sword over the
      head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when Prince
      John, more moved by the Templars dangerous situation than he had been by
      that of his rival, saved him the mortification of confessing himself
      vanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to the
      conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the fight which continued to
      burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the greater
      part had, by tacit consent, forborne the conflict for some time, leaving
      it to be determined by the strife of the leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squires, who had found it a matter of danger and difficulty to attend
      their masters during the engagement, now thronged into the lists to pay
      their dutiful attendance to the wounded, who were removed with the utmost
      care and attention to the neighbouring pavilions, or to the quarters
      prepared for them in the adjoining village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended the memorable field of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, one of the most
      gallantly contested tournaments of that age; for although only four
      knights, including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had
      died upon the field, yet upwards of thirty were desperately wounded, four
      or five of whom never recovered. Several more were disabled for life; and
      those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to the grave with
      them. Hence it is always mentioned in the old records, as the Gentle and
      Joyous Passage of Arms of Ashby.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being now the duty of Prince John to name the knight who had done best,
      he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight whom the
      popular voice had termed &ldquo;Le Noir Faineant.&rdquo; It was pointed out to the
      Prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had been in fact
      won by the Disinherited Knight, who, in the course of the day, had
      overcome six champions with his own hand, and who had finally unhorsed and
      struck down the leader of the opposite party. But Prince John adhered to
      his own opinion, on the ground that the Disinherited Knight and his party
      had lost the day, but for the powerful assistance of the Knight of the
      Black Armour, to whom, therefore, he persisted in awarding the prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was
      nowhere to be found. He had left the lists immediately when the conflict
      ceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of the
      forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and indifferent manner
      which had procured him the epithet of the Black Sluggard. After he had
      been summoned twice by sound of trumpet, and proclamation of the heralds,
      it became necessary to name another to receive the honours which had been
      assigned to him. Prince John had now no further excuse for resisting the
      claim of the Disinherited Knight, whom, therefore, he named the champion
      of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour and
      the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists again
      conducted the victor to the foot of Prince John's throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disinherited Knight,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;since by that title only you
      will consent to be known to us, we a second time award to you the honours
      of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and receive
      from the hands of the Queen of Love and Beauty, the Chaplet of Honour
      which your valour has justly deserved.&rdquo; The Knight bowed low and
      gracefully, but returned no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in
      proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor&mdash;while ladies
      waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks
      joined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the
      Disinherited Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of honour
      which was occupied by the Lady Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down.
      Indeed his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have
      been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will; and
      it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the second time across
      the lists. Rowena, descending from her station with a graceful and
      dignified step, was about to place the chaplet which she held in her hand
      upon the helmet of the champion, when the marshals exclaimed with one
      voice, &ldquo;It must not be thus&mdash;his head must be bare.&rdquo; The knight
      muttered faintly a few words, which were lost in the hollow of his helmet,
      but their purport seemed to be a desire that his casque might not be
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from love of form, or from curiosity, the marshals paid no
      attention to his expressions of reluctance, but unhelmed him by cutting
      the laces of his casque, and undoing the fastening of his gorget. When the
      helmet was removed, the well-formed, yet sun-burnt features of a young man
      of twenty-five were seen, amidst a profusion of short fair hair. His
      countenance was as pale as death, and marked in one or two places with
      streaks of blood.

    <p>
      Rowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek; but at
      once summoning up the energy of her disposition, and compelling herself,
      as it were, to proceed, while her frame yet trembled with the violence of
      sudden emotion, she placed upon the drooping head of the victor the
      splendid chaplet which was the destined reward of the day, and pronounced,
      in a clear and distinct tone, these words: &ldquo;I bestow on thee this chaplet,
      Sir Knight, as the meed of valour assigned to this day's victor:&rdquo; Here she
      paused a moment, and then firmly added, &ldquo;And upon brows more worthy could
      a wreath of chivalry never be placed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight stooped his head, and kissed the hand of the lovely Sovereign
      by whom his valour had been rewarded; and then, sinking yet farther
      forward, lay prostrate at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general consternation. Cedric, who had been struck mute by the
      sudden appearance of his banished son, now rushed forward, as if to
      separate him from Rowena. But this had been already accomplished by the
      marshals of the field, who, guessing the cause of Ivanhoe's swoon, had
      hastened to undo his armour, and found that the head of a lance had
      penetrated his breastplate, and inflicted a wound in his side.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Heroes, approach!&rdquo; Atrides thus aloud,
     &ldquo;Stand forth distinguish'd from the circling crowd,
     Ye who by skill or manly force may claim,
     Your rivals to surpass and merit fame.
     This cow, worth twenty oxen, is decreed,
     For him who farthest sends the winged reed.&rdquo;
      &mdash;Iliad
</pre>
    <p>
      The name of Ivanhoe was no sooner pronounced than it flew from mouth to
      mouth, with all the celerity with which eagerness could convey and
      curiosity receive it. It was not long ere it reached the circle of the
      Prince, whose brow darkened as he heard the news. Looking around him,
      however, with an air of scorn, &ldquo;My Lords,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and especially you,
      Sir Prior, what think ye of the doctrine the learned tell us, concerning
      innate attractions and antipathies? Methinks that I felt the presence of
      my brother's minion, even when I least guessed whom yonder suit of armour
      enclosed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Front-de-Boeuf must prepare to restore his fief of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said De
      Bracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in the tournament, had
      laid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the Prince's
      retinue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered Waldemar Fitzurse, &ldquo;this gallant is likely to reclaim the
      castle and manor which Richard assigned to him, and which your Highness's
      generosity has since given to Front-de-Boeuf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; replied John, &ldquo;is a man more willing to swallow three
      manors such as Ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. For the rest, sirs,
      I hope none here will deny my right to confer the fiefs of the crown upon
      the faithful followers who are around me, and ready to perform the usual
      military service, in the room of those who have wandered to foreign
      Countries, and can neither render homage nor service when called upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce the
      Prince's assumed right altogether indubitable. &ldquo;A generous Prince!&mdash;a
      most noble Lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of rewarding his
      faithful followers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of them of
      similar grants at the expense of King Richard's followers and favourites,
      if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer also assented to
      the general proposition, observing, however, &ldquo;That the blessed Jerusalem
      could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She was 'communis mater'&mdash;the
      mother of all Christians. But he saw not,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;how the Knight of
      Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from this, since he&rdquo; (the Prior) &ldquo;was
      assured that the crusaders, under Richard, had never proceeded much
      farther than Askalon, which, as all the world knew, was a town of the
      Philistines, and entitled to none of the privileges of the Holy City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where Ivanhoe had
      fallen to the ground, now returned. &ldquo;The gallant,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is likely to
      give your Highness little disturbance, and to leave Front-de-Boeuf in the
      quiet possession of his gains&mdash;he is severely wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever becomes of him,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;he is victor of the day; and
      were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother, which is
      perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to&mdash;our own physician
      shall attend him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stern smile curled the Prince's lip as he spoke. Waldemar Fitzurse
      hastened to reply, that Ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and in
      the custody of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was somewhat afflicted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see the grief of the Queen of
      Love and Beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into
      mourning. I am not a man to be moved by a woman's lament for her lover,
      but this same Lady Rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of
      manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her
      tearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form
      before her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;of whom we have heard so
      much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Saxon heiress of large possessions,&rdquo; replied the Prior Aymer; &ldquo;a rose
      of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a thousand, a
      bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall cheer her sorrows,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;and amend her blood, by
      wedding her to a Norman. She seems a minor, and must therefore be at our
      royal disposal in marriage.&mdash;How sayst thou, De Bracy? What thinkst
      thou of gaining fair lands and livings, by wedding a Saxon, after the
      fashion of the followers of the Conqueror?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the lands are to my liking, my lord,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;it will be
      hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will I hold myself bound to
      your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises made in
      favour of your servant and vassal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not forget it,&rdquo; said Prince John; &ldquo;and that we may instantly go
      to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the
      Lady Rowena and her company&mdash;that is, the rude churl her guardian,
      and the Saxon ox whom the Black Knight struck down in the tournament, upon
      this evening's banquet.&mdash;De Bigot,&rdquo; he added to his seneschal, &ldquo;thou
      wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the pride
      of these Saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse;
      although, by the bones of Becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls
      before swine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for
      retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whence?&rdquo; said Prince John, looking at the person by whom it was
      delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From foreign parts, my lord, but from whence I know not&rdquo; replied his
      attendant. &ldquo;A Frenchman brought it hither, who said, he had ridden night
      and day to put it into the hands of your highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the seal,
      placed so as to secure the flex-silk with which the billet was surrounded,
      and which bore the impression of three fleurs-de-lis. John then opened the
      billet with apparent agitation, which visibly and greatly increased when
      he had perused the contents, which were expressed in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take heed to yourself for the Devil is unchained!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince turned as pale as death, looked first on the earth, and then up
      to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of execution has
      been passed upon him. Recovering from the first effects of his surprise,
      he took Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy aside, and put the billet into
      their hands successively. &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; he added, in a faltering voice,
      &ldquo;that my brother Richard has obtained his freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,&rdquo; said De Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is France's own hand and seal,&rdquo; replied Prince John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time, then,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;to draw our party to a head, either at
      York, or some other centrical place. A few days later, and it will be
      indeed too late. Your highness must break short this present mummery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The yeomen and commons,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;must not be dismissed
      discontented, for lack of their share in the sports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;is not yet very far spent&mdash;let the archers
      shoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged. This will be
      an abundant fulfilment of the Prince's promises, so far as this herd of
      Saxon serfs is concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank thee, Waldemar,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;thou remindest me, too, that I
      have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday insulted our
      person. Our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we proposed. Were
      this my last hour of power, it should be an hour sacred to revenge and to
      pleasure&mdash;let new cares come with to-morrow's new day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already
      begun to leave the field; and proclamation was made that Prince John,
      suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties, held himself obliged
      to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrow's festival: Nevertheless,
      that, unwilling so many good yeoman should depart without a trial of
      skill, he was pleased to appoint them, before leaving the ground,
      presently to execute the competition of archery intended for the morrow.
      To the best archer a prize was to be awarded, being a bugle-horn, mounted
      with silver, and a silken baldric richly ornamented with a medallion of St
      Hubert, the patron of silvan sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors,
      several of whom were rangers and under-keepers in the royal forests of
      Needwood and Charnwood. When, however, the archers understood with whom
      they were to be matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the
      contest, unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat.
      For in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well known
      for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at Newmarket
      are familiar to those who frequent that well-known meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to
      eight. Prince John stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the
      persons of these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery.
      Having satisfied his curiosity by this investigation, he looked for the
      object of his resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot, and
      with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the
      preceding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;I guessed by thy insolent babble that thou
      wert no true lover of the longbow, and I see thou darest not adventure thy
      skill among such merry-men as stand yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under favour, sir,&rdquo; replied the yeoman, &ldquo;I have another reason for
      refraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is thy other reason?&rdquo; said Prince John, who, for some cause
      which perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful
      curiosity respecting this individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the woodsman, &ldquo;I know not if these yeomen and I are
      used to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, I know not how
      your Grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has
      unwittingly fallen under your displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John coloured as he put the question, &ldquo;What is thy name, yeoman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locksley,&rdquo; answered the yeoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Locksley,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;thou shalt shoot in thy turn, when
      these yeomen have displayed their skill. If thou carriest the prize, I
      will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt be stript
      of thy Lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with bowstrings, for a
      wordy and insolent braggart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?&rdquo; said the yeoman.&mdash;&ldquo;Your
      Grace's power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, may indeed
      easily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my
      bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou refusest my fair proffer,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;the Provost of the
      lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, and expel thee
      from the presence as a faint-hearted craven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no fair chance you put on me, proud Prince,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;to
      compel me to peril myself against the best archers of Leicester And
      Staffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me.
      Nevertheless, I will obey your pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to him close, men-at-arms,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;his heart is sinking;
      I am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.&mdash;And do you, good
      fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready for your
      refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize is won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led to
      the lists. The contending archers took their station in turn, at the
      bottom of the southern access, the distance between that station and the
      mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rovers. The
      archers, having previously determined by lot their order of precedence,
      were to shoot each three shafts in succession. The sports were regulated
      by an officer of inferior rank, termed the Provost of the Games; for the
      high rank of the marshals of the lists would have been held degraded, had
      they condescended to superintend the sports of the yeomanry.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts
      yeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession, ten
      were fixed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that,
      considering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery. Of
      the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot
      by Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, who was accordingly
      pronounced victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Locksley,&rdquo; said Prince John to the bold yeoman, with a bitter smile,
      &ldquo;wilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or wilt thou yield up bow,
      baldric, and quiver, to the Provost of the sports?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sith it be no better,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;I am content to try my fortune; on
      condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder mark of Hubert's, he
      shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is but fair,&rdquo; answered Prince John, &ldquo;and it shall not be refused
      thee.&mdash;If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will fill the bugle
      with silver-pennies for thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can do but his best,&rdquo; answered Hubert; &ldquo;but my grandsire drew a
      good long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour his memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size placed
      in its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the first trial of skill, had the
      right to shoot first, took his aim with great deliberation, long measuring
      the distance with his eye, while he held in his hand his bended bow, with
      the arrow placed on the string. At length he made a step forward, and
      raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm, till the centre or
      grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he drew his bowstring to his
      ear. The arrow whistled through the air, and lighted within the inner ring
      of the target, but not exactly in the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not allowed for the wind, Hubert,&rdquo; said his antagonist, bending
      his bow, &ldquo;or that had been a better shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim,
      Locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as carelessly
      in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He was speaking
      almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring, yet it alighted
      in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the centre
      than that of Hubert.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0197.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the light of heaven!&rdquo; said Prince John to Hubert, &ldquo;an thou suffer that
      runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hubert had but one set speech for all occasions. &ldquo;An your highness were to
      hang me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a man can but do his best. Nevertheless, my grandsire
      drew a good bow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!&rdquo; interrupted
      John, &ldquo;shoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worse for
      thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the caution
      which he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary allowance
      for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, and shot so
      successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Hubert! a Hubert!&rdquo; shouted the populace, more interested in a known
      person than in a stranger. &ldquo;In the clout!&mdash;in the clout!&mdash;a
      Hubert for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou canst not mend that shot, Locksley,&rdquo; said the Prince, with an
      insulting smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will notch his shaft for him, however,&rdquo; replied Locksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      And letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it
      lighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers. The
      people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity,
      that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their usual
      clamour. &ldquo;This must be the devil, and no man of flesh and blood,&rdquo;
       whispered the yeomen to each other; &ldquo;such archery was never seen since a
      bow was first bent in Britain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;I will crave your Grace's permission to plant
      such a mark as is used in the North Country; and welcome every brave
      yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he
      loves best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then turned to leave the lists. &ldquo;Let your guards attend me,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;if you please&mdash;I go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John made a signal that some attendants should follow him in case
      of his escape: but the cry of &ldquo;Shame! shame!&rdquo; which burst from the
      multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in
      length, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man's thumb. He
      began to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time, that
      to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had hitherto been
      used, was to put shame upon his skill. &ldquo;For his own part,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
      in the land where he was bred, men would as soon take for their mark King
      Arthur's round-table, which held sixty knights around it. A child of seven
      years old,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might hit yonder target with a headless shaft; but,&rdquo;
       added he, walking deliberately to the other end of the lists, and sticking
      the willow wand upright in the ground, &ldquo;he that hits that rod at
      five-score yards, I call him an archer fit to bear both bow and quiver
      before a king, an it were the stout King Richard himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandsire,&rdquo; said Hubert, &ldquo;drew a good bow at the battle of Hastings,
      and never shot at such a mark in his life&mdash;and neither will I. If
      this yeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers&mdash;or rather,
      I yield to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a
      man can but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I
      might as well shoot at the edge of our parson's whittle, or at a wheat
      straw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I can hardly
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cowardly dog!&rdquo; said Prince John.&mdash;&ldquo;Sirrah Locksley, do thou shoot;
      but, if thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the first man ever
      did so. However it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of
      superior skill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best, as Hubert says,&rdquo; answered Locksley; &ldquo;no man can do
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked with
      attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought was no
      longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former shots.
      He then took his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude awaited the
      event in breathless silence. The archer vindicated their opinion of his
      skill: his arrow split the willow rod against which it was aimed. A
      jubilee of acclamations followed; and even Prince John, in admiration of
      Locksley's skill, lost for an instant his dislike to his person. &ldquo;These
      twenty nobles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which, with the bugle, thou hast fairly won, are
      thine own; we will make them fifty, if thou wilt take livery and service
      with us as a yeoman of our body guard, and be near to our person. For
      never did so strong a hand bend a bow, or so true an eye direct a shaft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, noble Prince,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;but I have vowed, that if ever
      I take service, it should be with your royal brother King Richard. These
      twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave a bow as
      his grandsire did at Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the trial, he
      would have hit the wand as well I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the
      stranger, and Locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed with
      the crowd, and was seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped John's attention so
      easily, had not that Prince had other subjects of anxious and more
      important meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. He called
      upon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists,
      and commanded him instantly to gallop to Ashby, and seek out Isaac the
      Jew. &ldquo;Tell the dog,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to send me, before sun-down, two thousand
      crowns. He knows the security; but thou mayst show him this ring for a
      token. The rest of the money must be paid at York within six days. If he
      neglects, I will have the unbelieving villain's head. Look that thou pass
      him not on the way; for the circumcised slave was displaying his stolen
      finery amongst us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the Prince resumed his horse, and returned to Ashby, the whole
      crowd breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In rough magnificence array'd,
     When ancient Chivalry display'd
     The pomp of her heroic games,
     And crested chiefs and tissued dames
     Assembled, at the clarion's call,
     In some proud castle's high arch'd hall.
     &mdash;Warton
</pre>
    <p>
      Prince John held his high festival in the Castle of Ashby. This was not
      the same building of which the stately ruins still interest the traveller,
      and which was erected at a later period by the Lord Hastings, High
      Chamberlain of England, one of the first victims of the tyranny of Richard
      the Third, and yet better known as one of Shakspeare's characters than by
      his historical fame. The castle and town of Ashby, at this time, belonged
      to Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, who, during the period of our
      history, was absent in the Holy Land. Prince John, in the meanwhile,
      occupied his castle, and disposed of his domains without scruple; and
      seeking at present to dazzle men's eyes by his hospitality and
      magnificence, had given orders for great preparations, in order to render
      the banquet as splendid as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purveyors of the Prince, who exercised on this and other occasions the
      full authority of royalty, had swept the country of all that could be
      collected which was esteemed fit for their master's table. Guests also
      were invited in great numbers; and in the necessity in which he then found
      himself of courting popularity, Prince John had extended his invitation to
      a few distinguished Saxon and Danish families, as well as to the Norman
      nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. However despised and degraded on
      ordinary occasions, the great numbers of the Anglo-Saxons must necessarily
      render them formidable in the civil commotions which seemed approaching,
      and it was an obvious point of policy to secure popularity with their
      leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was accordingly the Prince's intention, which he for some time
      maintained, to treat these unwonted guests with a courtesy to which they
      had been little accustomed. But although no man with less scruple made his
      ordinary habits and feelings bend to his interest, it was the misfortune
      of this Prince, that his levity and petulance were perpetually breaking
      out, and undoing all that had been gained by his previous dissimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this fickle temper he gave a memorable example in Ireland, when sent
      thither by his father, Henry the Second, with the purpose of buying golden
      opinions of the inhabitants of that new and important acquisition to the
      English crown. Upon this occasion the Irish chieftains contended which
      should first offer to the young Prince their loyal homage and the kiss of
      peace. But, instead of receiving their salutations with courtesy, John and
      his petulant attendants could not resist the temptation of pulling the
      long beards of the Irish chieftains; a conduct which, as might have been
      expected, was highly resented by these insulted dignitaries, and produced
      fatal consequences to the English domination in Ireland. It is necessary
      to keep these inconsistencies of John's character in view, that the reader
      may understand his conduct during the present evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      In execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler
      moments, Prince John received Cedric and Athelstane with distinguished
      courtesy, and expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when the
      indisposition of Rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her not
      attending upon his gracious summons. Cedric and Athelstane were both
      dressed in the ancient Saxon garb, which, although not unhandsome in
      itself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials, was so
      remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests, that Prince
      John took great credit to himself with Waldemar Fitzurse for refraining
      from laughter at a sight which the fashion of the day rendered ridiculous.
      Yet, in the eye of sober judgment, the short close tunic and long mantle
      of the Saxons was a more graceful, as well as a more convenient dress,
      than the garb of the Normans, whose under garment was a long doublet, so
      loose as to resemble a shirt or waggoner's frock, covered by a cloak of
      scanty dimensions, neither fit to defend the wearer from cold or from
      rain, and the only purpose of which appeared to be to display as much fur,
      embroidery, and jewellery work, as the ingenuity of the tailor could
      contrive to lay upon it. The Emperor Charlemagne, in whose reign they were
      first introduced, seems to have been very sensible of the inconveniences
      arising from the fashion of this garment. &ldquo;In Heaven's name,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
      what purpose serve these abridged cloaks? If we are in bed they are no
      cover, on horseback they are no protection from the wind and rain, and
      when seated, they do not guard our legs from the damp or the frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, spite of this imperial objurgation, the short cloaks
      continued in fashion down to the time of which we treat, and particularly
      among the princes of the House of Anjou. They were therefore in universal
      use among Prince John's courtiers; and the long mantle, which formed the
      upper garment of the Saxons, was held in proportional derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of good
      cheer. The numerous cooks who attended on the Prince's progress, having
      exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary
      provisions were served up, had succeeded almost as well as the modern
      professors of the culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their
      natural appearance. Besides these dishes of domestic origin, there were
      various delicacies brought from foreign parts, and a quantity of rich
      pastry, as well as of the simnel-bread and wastle cakes, which were only
      used at the tables of the highest nobility. The banquet was crowned with
      the richest wines, both foreign and domestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though luxurious, the Norman nobles were not generally speaking an
      intemperate race. While indulging themselves in the pleasures of the
      table, they aimed at delicacy, but avoided excess, and were apt to
      attribute gluttony and drunkenness to the vanquished Saxons, as vices
      peculiar to their inferior station. Prince John, indeed, and those who
      courted his pleasure by imitating his foibles, were apt to indulge to
      excess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet; and indeed it is
      well known that his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches and new
      ale. His conduct, however, was an exception to the general manners of his
      countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the
      Norman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of Athelstane and
      Cedric at a banquet, to the form and fashion of which they were
      unaccustomed. And while their manners were thus the subject of sarcastic
      observation, the untaught Saxons unwittingly transgressed several of the
      arbitrary rules established for the regulation of society. Now, it is well
      known, that a man may with more impunity be guilty of an actual breach
      either of real good breeding or of good morals, than appear ignorant of
      the most minute point of fashionable etiquette. Thus Cedric, who dried his
      hands with a towel, instead of suffering the moisture to exhale by waving
      them gracefully in the air, incurred more ridicule than his companion
      Athelstane, when he swallowed to his own single share the whole of a large
      pasty composed of the most exquisite foreign delicacies, and termed at
      that time a &ldquo;Karum-Pie&rdquo;. When, however, it was discovered, by a serious
      cross-examination, that the Thane of Coningsburgh (or Franklin, as the
      Normans termed him) had no idea what he had been devouring, and that he
      had taken the contents of the Karum-pie for larks and pigeons, whereas
      they were in fact beccaficoes and nightingales, his ignorance brought him
      in for an ample share of the ridicule which would have been more justly
      bestowed on his gluttony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated
      freely, men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,&mdash;of the
      unknown victor in the archery games, of the Black Knight, whose
      self-denial had induced him to withdraw from the honours he had won,&mdash;and
      of the gallant Ivanhoe, who had so dearly bought the honours of the day.
      The topics were treated with military frankness, and the jest and laugh
      went round the hall. The brow of Prince John alone was overclouded during
      these discussions; some overpowering care seemed agitating his mind, and
      it was only when he received occasional hints from his attendants, that he
      seemed to take interest in what was passing around him. On such occasions
      he would start up, quaff a cup of wine as if to raise his spirits, and
      then mingle in the conversation by some observation made abruptly or at
      random.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We drink this beaker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the health of Wilfred of Ivanhoe,
      champion of this Passage of Arms, and grieve that his wound renders him
      absent from our board&mdash;Let all fill to the pledge, and especially
      Cedric of Rotherwood, the worthy father of a son so promising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; replied Cedric, standing up, and placing on the table his
      untasted cup, &ldquo;I yield not the name of son to the disobedient youth, who
      at once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners and customs of
      his fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis impossible,&rdquo; cried Prince John, with well-feigned astonishment,
      &ldquo;that so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or disobedient son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, my lord,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;so it is with this Wilfred. He left my
      homely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of your brother's court,
      where he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship which you prize so
      highly. He left it contrary to my wish and command; and in the days of
      Alfred that would have been termed disobedience&mdash;ay, and a crime
      severely punishable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied Prince John, with a deep sigh of affected sympathy, &ldquo;since
      your son was a follower of my unhappy brother, it need not be enquired
      where or from whom he learned the lesson of filial disobedience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus spake Prince John, wilfully forgetting, that of all the sons of Henry
      the Second, though no one was free from the charge, he himself had been
      most distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, after a moment's pause, &ldquo;that my brother proposed to
      confer upon his favourite the rich manor of Ivanhoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did endow him with it,&rdquo; answered Cedric; &ldquo;nor is it my least quarrel
      with my son, that he stooped to hold, as a feudal vassal, the very domains
      which his fathers possessed in free and independent right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall then have your willing sanction, good Cedric,&rdquo; said Prince John,
      &ldquo;to confer this fief upon a person whose dignity will not be diminished by
      holding land of the British crown.&mdash;Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; he
      said, turning towards that Baron, &ldquo;I trust you will so keep the goodly
      Barony of Ivanhoe, that Sir Wilfred shall not incur his father's farther
      displeasure by again entering upon that fief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Anthony!&rdquo; answered the black-brow'd giant, &ldquo;I will consent that
      your highness shall hold me a Saxon, if either Cedric or Wilfred, or the
      best that ever bore English blood, shall wrench from me the gift with
      which your highness has graced me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever shall call thee Saxon, Sir Baron,&rdquo; replied Cedric, offended at a
      mode of expression by which the Normans frequently expressed their
      habitual contempt of the English, &ldquo;will do thee an honour as great as it
      is undeserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Front-de-Boeuf would have replied, but Prince John's petulance and levity
      got the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said be, &ldquo;my lords, the noble Cedric speaks truth; and his
      race may claim precedence over us as much in the length of their pedigrees
      as in the longitude of their cloaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They go before us indeed in the field&mdash;as deer before dogs,&rdquo; said
      Malvoisin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with good right may they go before us&mdash;forget not,&rdquo; said the
      Prior Aymer, &ldquo;the superior decency and decorum of their manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their singular abstemiousness and temperance,&rdquo; said De Bracy, forgetting
      the plan which promised him a Saxon bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Together with the courage and conduct,&rdquo; said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;by
      which they distinguished themselves at Hastings and elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While, with smooth and smiling cheek, the courtiers, each in turn,
      followed their Prince's example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule at Cedric,
      the face of the Saxon became inflamed with passion, and he glanced his
      eyes fiercely from one to another, as if the quick succession of so many
      injuries had prevented his replying to them in turn; or, like a baited
      bull, who, surrounded by his tormentors, is at a loss to choose from among
      them the immediate object of his revenge. At length he spoke, in a voice
      half choked with passion; and, addressing himself to Prince John as the
      head and front of the offence which he had received, &ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;have been the follies and vices of our race, a Saxon would have been held
      'nidering',&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21"       id="linknoteref-21"><small>21</small></a> (the most emphatic term for
      abject worthlessness,) &ldquo;who should in his own hall, and while his own
      wine-cup passed, have treated, or suffered to be treated, an unoffending
      guest as your highness has this day beheld me used; and whatever was the
      misfortune of our fathers on the field of Hastings, those may at least be
      silent,&rdquo; here he looked at Front-de-Boeuf and the Templar, &ldquo;who have
      within these few hours once and again lost saddle and stirrup before the
      lance of a Saxon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith, a biting jest!&rdquo; said Prince John. &ldquo;How like you it, sirs?&mdash;Our
      Saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage; become shrewd in wit, and bold
      in bearing, in these unsettled times&mdash;What say ye, my lords?&mdash;By
      this good light, I hold it best to take our galleys, and return to
      Normandy in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For fear of the Saxons?&rdquo; said De Bracy, laughing; &ldquo;we should need no
      weapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce with your raillery, Sir Knights,&rdquo; said Fitzurse;&mdash;&ldquo;and it
      were well,&rdquo; he added, addressing the Prince, &ldquo;that your highness should
      assure the worthy Cedric there is no insult intended him by jests, which
      must sound but harshly in the ear of a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insult?&rdquo; answered Prince John, resuming his courtesy of demeanour; &ldquo;I
      trust it will not be thought that I could mean, or permit any, to be
      offered in my presence. Here! I fill my cup to Cedric himself, since he
      refuses to pledge his son's health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers,
      which, however, failed to make the impression on the mind of the Saxon
      that had been designed. He was not naturally acute of perception, but
      those too much undervalued his understanding who deemed that this
      flattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult. He
      was silent, however, when the royal pledge again passed round, &ldquo;To Sir
      Athelstane of Coningsburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by
      draining a huge goblet in answer to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sirs,&rdquo; said Prince John, who began to be warmed with the wine
      which he had drank, &ldquo;having done justice to our Saxon guests, we will pray
      of them some requital to our courtesy.&mdash;Worthy Thane,&rdquo; he continued,
      addressing Cedric, &ldquo;may we pray you to name to us some Norman whose
      mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with a goblet of wine
      all bitterness which the sound may leave behind it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fitzurse arose while Prince John spoke, and gliding behind the seat of the
      Saxon, whispered to him not to omit the opportunity of putting an end to
      unkindness betwixt the two races, by naming Prince John. The Saxon replied
      not to this politic insinuation, but, rising up, and filling his cup to
      the brim, he addressed Prince John in these words: &ldquo;Your highness has
      required that I should name a Norman deserving to be remembered at our
      banquet. This, perchance, is a hard task, since it calls on the slave to
      sing the praises of the master&mdash;upon the vanquished, while pressed by
      all the evils of conquest, to sing the praises of the conqueror. Yet I
      will name a Norman&mdash;the first in arms and in place&mdash;the best and
      the noblest of his race. And the lips that shall refuse to pledge me to
      his well-earned fame, I term false and dishonoured, and will so maintain
      them with my life.&mdash;I quaff this goblet to the health of Richard the
      Lion-hearted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John, who had expected that his own name would have closed the
      Saxon's speech, started when that of his injured brother was so
      unexpectedly introduced. He raised mechanically the wine-cup to his lips,
      then instantly set it down, to view the demeanour of the company at this
      unexpected proposal, which many of them felt it as unsafe to oppose as to
      comply with. Some of them, ancient and experienced courtiers, closely
      imitated the example of the Prince himself, raising the goblet to their
      lips, and again replacing it before them. There were many who, with a more
      generous feeling, exclaimed, &ldquo;Long live King Richard! and may he be
      speedily restored to us!&rdquo; And some few, among whom were Front-de-Boeuf and
      the Templar, in sullen disdain suffered their goblets to stand untasted
      before them. But no man ventured directly to gainsay a pledge filled to
      the health of the reigning monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, Cedric said to his
      companion, &ldquo;Up, noble Athelstane! we have remained here long enough, since
      we have requited the hospitable courtesy of Prince John's banquet. Those
      who wish to know further of our rude Saxon manners must henceforth seek us
      in the homes of our fathers, since we have seen enough of royal banquets,
      and enough of Norman courtesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by Athelstane,
      and by several other guests, who, partaking of the Saxon lineage, held
      themselves insulted by the sarcasms of Prince John and his courtiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bones of St Thomas,&rdquo; said Prince John, as they retreated, &ldquo;the
      Saxon churls have borne off the best of the day, and have retreated with
      triumph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Conclamatum est, poculatum est',&rdquo; said Prior Aymer; &ldquo;we have drunk and
      we have shouted,&mdash;it were time we left our wine flagons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The monk hath some fair penitent to shrive to-night, that he is in such a
      hurry to depart,&rdquo; said De Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied the Abbot; &ldquo;but I must move several miles
      forward this evening upon my homeward journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are breaking up,&rdquo; said the Prince in a whisper to Fitzurse; &ldquo;their
      fears anticipate the event, and this coward Prior is the first to shrink
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not, my lord,&rdquo; said Waldemar; &ldquo;I will show him such reasons as shall
      induce him to join us when we hold our meeting at York.&mdash;Sir Prior,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;I must speak with you in private, before you mount your
      palfrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other guests were now fast dispersing, with the exception of those
      immediately attached to Prince John's faction, and his retinue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then, is the result of your advice,&rdquo; said the Prince, turning an
      angry countenance upon Fitzurse; &ldquo;that I should be bearded at my own board
      by a drunken Saxon churl, and that, on the mere sound of my brother's
      name, men should fall off from me as if I had the leprosy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience, sir,&rdquo; replied his counsellor; &ldquo;I might retort your
      accusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my design, and
      misled your own better judgment. But this is no time for recrimination. De
      Bracy and I will instantly go among these shuffling cowards, and convince
      them they have gone too far to recede.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be in vain,&rdquo; said Prince John, pacing the apartment with
      disordered steps, and expressing himself with an agitation to which the
      wine he had drank partly contributed&mdash;&ldquo;It will be in vain&mdash;they
      have seen the handwriting on the wall&mdash;they have marked the paw of
      the lion in the sand&mdash;they have heard his approaching roar shake the
      wood&mdash;nothing will reanimate their courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said Fitzurse to De Bracy, &ldquo;that aught could reanimate his
      own! His brother's very name is an ague to him. Unhappy are the
      counsellors of a Prince, who wants fortitude and perseverance alike in
      good and in evil!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And yet he thinks,&mdash;ha, ha, ha, ha,&mdash;he thinks
     I am the tool and servant of his will.
     Well, let it be; through all the maze of trouble
     His plots and base oppression must create,
     I'll shape myself a way to higher things,
     And who will say 'tis wrong?
     &mdash;Basil, a Tragedy
</pre>
    <p>
      No spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his web,
      than did Waldemar Fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered members of
      Prince John's cabal. Few of these were attached to him from inclination,
      and none from personal regard. It was therefore necessary, that Fitzurse
      should open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind them of those
      which they at present enjoyed. To the young and wild nobles, he held out
      the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled revelry; to the
      ambitious, that of power, and to the covetous, that of increased wealth
      and extended domains. The leaders of the mercenaries received a donation
      in gold; an argument the most persuasive to their minds, and without which
      all others would have proved in vain. Promises were still more liberally
      distributed than money by this active agent; and, in fine, nothing was
      left undone that could determine the wavering, or animate the
      disheartened. The return of King Richard he spoke of as an event
      altogether beyond the reach of probability; yet, when he observed, from
      the doubtful looks and uncertain answers which he received, that this was
      the apprehension by which the minds of his accomplices were most haunted,
      he boldly treated that event, should it really take place, as one which
      ought not to alter their political calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Richard returns,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;he returns to enrich his needy and
      impoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did not follow him to
      the Holy Land. He returns to call to a fearful reckoning, those who,
      during his absence, have done aught that can be construed offence or
      encroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of the
      crown. He returns to avenge upon the Orders of the Temple and the
      Hospital, the preference which they showed to Philip of France during the
      wars in the Holy Land. He returns, in fine, to punish as a rebel every
      adherent of his brother Prince John. Are ye afraid of his power?&rdquo;
       continued the artful confident of that Prince, &ldquo;we acknowledge him a
      strong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of King Arthur, when
      a champion could encounter an army. If Richard indeed comes back, it must
      be alone,&mdash;unfollowed&mdash;unfriended. The bones of his gallant army
      have whitened the sands of Palestine. The few of his followers who have
      returned have straggled hither like this Wilfred of Ivanhoe, beggared and
      broken men.&mdash;And what talk ye of Richard's right of birth?&rdquo; he
      proceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. &ldquo;Is
      Richard's title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of Duke
      Robert of Normandy, the Conqueror's eldest son? And yet William the Red,
      and Henry, his second and third brothers, were successively preferred to
      him by the voice of the nation, Robert had every merit which can be
      pleaded for Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader, generous to his
      friends and to the church, and, to crown the whole, a crusader and a
      conqueror of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind and miserable
      prisoner in the Castle of Cardiff, because he opposed himself to the will
      of the people, who chose that he should not rule over them. It is our
      right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to choose from the blood royal the prince who is best
      qualified to hold the supreme power&mdash;that is,&rdquo; said he, correcting
      himself, &ldquo;him whose election will best promote the interests of the
      nobility. In personal qualifications,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it was possible that
      Prince John might be inferior to his brother Richard; but when it was
      considered that the latter returned with the sword of vengeance in his
      hand, while the former held out rewards, immunities, privileges, wealth,
      and honours, it could not be doubted which was the king whom in wisdom the
      nobility were called on to support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar circumstances
      of those whom he addressed, had the expected weight with the nobles of
      Prince John's faction. Most of them consented to attend the proposed
      meeting at York, for the purpose of making general arrangements for
      placing the crown upon the head of Prince John.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various
      exertions, however gratified with the result, Fitzurse, returning to the
      Castle of Ashby, met with De Bracy, who had exchanged his banqueting
      garments for a short green kirtle, with hose of the same cloth and colour,
      a leathern cap or head-piece, a short sword, a horn slung over his
      shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a bundle of arrows stuck in his
      belt. Had Fitzurse met this figure in an outer apartment, he would have
      passed him without notice, as one of the yeomen of the guard; but finding
      him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more attention, and
      recognised the Norman knight in the dress of an English yeoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mummery is this, De Bracy?&rdquo; said Fitzurse, somewhat angrily; &ldquo;is
      this a time for Christmas gambols and quaint maskings, when the fate of
      our master, Prince John, is on the very verge of decision? Why hast thou
      not been, like me, among these heartless cravens, whom the very name of
      King Richard terrifies, as it is said to do the children of the Saracens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been attending to mine own business,&rdquo; answered De Bracy calmly,
      &ldquo;as you, Fitzurse, have been minding yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I minding mine own business!&rdquo; echoed Waldemar; &ldquo;I have been engaged in
      that of Prince John, our joint patron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if thou hadst any other reason for that, Waldemar,&rdquo; said De Bracy,
      &ldquo;than the promotion of thine own individual interest? Come, Fitzurse, we
      know each other&mdash;ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine, and they
      become our different ages. Of Prince John thou thinkest as I do; that he
      is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy
      monarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too
      fickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch by
      whom Fitzurse and De Bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you aid
      him with your policy, and I with the lances of my Free Companions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hopeful auxiliary,&rdquo; said Fitzurse impatiently; &ldquo;playing the fool in the
      very moment of utter necessity.&mdash;What on earth dost thou purpose by
      this absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get me a wife,&rdquo; answered De Bracy coolly, &ldquo;after the manner of the
      tribe of Benjamin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tribe of Benjamin?&rdquo; said Fitzurse; &ldquo;I comprehend thee not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wert thou not in presence yester-even,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;when we heard the
      Prior Aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung by the
      Minstrel?&mdash;He told how, long since in Palestine, a deadly feud arose
      between the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the Israelitish nation; and
      how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that tribe; and how
      they swore by our blessed Lady, that they would not permit those who
      remained to marry in their lineage; and how they became grieved for their
      vow, and sent to consult his holiness the Pope how they might be absolved
      from it; and how, by the advice of the Holy Father, the youth of the tribe
      of Benjamin carried off from a superb tournament all the ladies who were
      there present, and thus won them wives without the consent either of their
      brides or their brides' families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard the story,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;though either the Prior or thou
      has made some singular alterations in date and circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;that I mean to purvey me a wife after the
      fashion of the tribe of Benjamin; which is as much as to say, that in this
      same equipment I will fall upon that herd of Saxon bullocks, who have this
      night left the castle, and carry off from them the lovely Rowena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou mad, De Bracy?&rdquo; said Fitzurse. &ldquo;Bethink thee that, though the
      men be Saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regarded with the more
      respect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of few
      of Saxon descent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And should belong to none,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;the work of the Conquest
      should be completed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no time for it at least,&rdquo; said Fitzurse &ldquo;the approaching crisis
      renders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and Prince John cannot
      refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him grant it, if he dare,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;he will soon see the
      difference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine, and
      that of a heartless mob of Saxon churls. Yet I mean no immediate discovery
      of myself. Seem I not in this garb as bold a forester as ever blew horn?
      The blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the Yorkshire
      forests. I have sure spies on the Saxon's motions&mdash;To-night they
      sleep in the convent of Saint Wittol, or Withold, or whatever they call
      that churl of a Saxon Saint at Burton-on-Trent. Next day's march brings
      them within our reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them at once.
      Presently after I will appear in mine own shape, play the courteous
      knight, rescue the unfortunate and afflicted fair one from the hands of
      the rude ravishers, conduct her to Front-de-Boeuf's Castle, or to
      Normandy, if it should be necessary, and produce her not again to her
      kindred until she be the bride and dame of Maurice de Bracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A marvellously sage plan,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;and, as I think, not entirely
      of thine own device.&mdash;Come, be frank, De Bracy, who aided thee in the
      invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as I think, thine
      own band lies as far off as York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, if thou must needs know,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;it was the Templar Brian
      de Bois-Guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, which the adventure of
      the men of Benjamin suggested to me. He is to aid me in the onslaught, and
      he and his followers will personate the outlaws, from whom my valorous arm
      is, after changing my garb, to rescue the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my halidome,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;the plan was worthy of your united
      wisdom! and thy prudence, De Bracy, is most especially manifested in the
      project of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate. Thou
      mayst, I think, succeed in taking her from her Saxon friends, but how thou
      wilt rescue her afterwards from the clutches of Bois-Guilbert seems
      considerably more doubtful&mdash;He is a falcon well accustomed to pounce
      on a partridge, and to hold his prey fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Templar,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;and cannot therefore rival me in my
      plan of wedding this heiress;&mdash;and to attempt aught dishonourable
      against the intended bride of De Bracy&mdash;By Heaven! were he a whole
      Chapter of his Order in his single person, he dared not do me such an
      injury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then since nought that I can say,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;will put this folly
      from thy imagination, (for well I know the obstinacy of thy disposition,)
      at least waste as little time as possible&mdash;let not thy folly be
      lasting as well as untimely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;that it will be the work of a few
      hours, and I shall be at York&mdash;at the head of my daring and valorous
      fellows, as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to form
      one.&mdash;But I hear my comrades assembling, and the steeds stamping and
      neighing in the outer court.&mdash;Farewell.&mdash;I go, like a true
      knight, to win the smiles of beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a true knight?&rdquo; repeated Fitzurse, looking after him; &ldquo;like a fool,
      I should say, or like a child, who will leave the most serious and needful
      occupation, to chase the down of the thistle that drives past him.&mdash;But
      it is with such tools that I must work;&mdash;and for whose advantage?&mdash;For
      that of a Prince as unwise as he is profligate, and as likely to be an
      ungrateful master as he has already proved a rebellious son and an
      unnatural brother.&mdash;But he&mdash;he, too, is but one of the tools
      with which I labour; and, proud as he is, should he presume to separate
      his interest from mine, this is a secret which he shall soon learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice of the
      Prince from an interior apartment, calling out, &ldquo;Noble Waldemar Fitzurse!&rdquo;
       and, with bonnet doffed, the future Chancellor (for to such high
      preferment did the wily Norman aspire) hastened to receive the orders of
      the future sovereign.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Far in a wild, unknown to public view,
     From youth to age a reverend hermit grew;
     The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,
     His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well
     Remote from man, with God he pass'd his days,
     Prayer all his business&mdash;all his pleasure praise.
     &mdash;Parnell
</pre>
    <p>
      The reader cannot have forgotten that the event of the tournament was
      decided by the exertions of an unknown knight, whom, on account of the
      passive and indifferent conduct which he had manifested on the former part
      of the day, the spectators had entitled, &ldquo;Le Noir Faineant&rdquo;. This knight
      had left the field abruptly when the victory was achieved; and when he was
      called upon to receive the reward of his valour, he was nowhere to be
      found. In the meantime, while summoned by heralds and by trumpets, the
      knight was holding his course northward, avoiding all frequented paths,
      and taking the shortest road through the woodlands. He paused for the
      night at a small hostelry lying out of the ordinary route, where, however,
      he obtained from a wandering minstrel news of the event of the tourney.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next morning the knight departed early, with the intention of
      making a long journey; the condition of his horse, which he had carefully
      spared during the preceding morning, being such as enabled him to travel
      far without the necessity of much repose. Yet his purpose was baffled by
      the devious paths through which he rode, so that when evening closed upon
      him, he only found himself on the frontiers of the West Riding of
      Yorkshire. By this time both horse and man required refreshment, and it
      became necessary, moreover, to look out for some place in which they might
      spend the night, which was now fast approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for
      obtaining either shelter or refreshment, and he was likely to be reduced
      to the usual expedient of knights-errant, who, on such occasions, turned
      their horses to graze, and laid themselves down to meditate on their
      lady-mistress, with an oak-tree for a canopy. But the Black Knight either
      had no mistress to meditate upon, or, being as indifferent in love as he
      seemed to be in war, was not sufficiently occupied by passionate
      reflections upon her beauty and cruelty, to be able to parry the effects
      of fatigue and hunger, and suffer love to act as a substitute for the
      solid comforts of a bed and supper. He felt dissatisfied, therefore, when,
      looking around, he found himself deeply involved in woods, through which
      indeed there were many open glades, and some paths, but such as seemed
      only formed by the numerous herds of cattle which grazed in the forest, or
      by the animals of chase, and the hunters who made prey of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun, by which the knight had chiefly directed his course, had now sunk
      behind the Derbyshire hills on his left, and every effort which he might
      make to pursue his journey was as likely to lead him out of his road as to
      advance him on his route. After having in vain endeavoured to select the
      most beaten path, in hopes it might lead to the cottage of some herdsman,
      or the silvan lodge of a forester, and having repeatedly found himself
      totally unable to determine on a choice, the knight resolved to trust to
      the sagacity of his horse; experience having, on former occasions, made
      him acquainted with the wonderful talent possessed by these animals for
      extricating themselves and their riders on such emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good steed, grievously fatigued with so long a day's journey under a
      rider cased in mail, had no sooner found, by the slackened reins, that he
      was abandoned to his own guidance, than he seemed to assume new strength
      and spirit; and whereas, formerly he had scarce replied to the spur,
      otherwise than by a groan, he now, as if proud of the confidence reposed
      in him, pricked up his ears, and assumed, of his own accord, a more lively
      motion. The path which the animal adopted rather turned off from the
      course pursued by the knight during the day; but as the horse seemed
      confident in his choice, the rider abandoned himself to his discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was justified by the event; for the footpath soon after appeared a
      little wider and more worn, and the tinkle of a small bell gave the knight
      to understand that he was in the vicinity of some chapel or hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he soon reached an open plat of turf, on the opposite side of
      which, a rock, rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain, offered its
      grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its sides in
      some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots found
      nourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below,
      like the plumage of the warrior over his steel helmet, giving grace to
      that whose chief expression was terror. At the bottom of the rock, and
      leaning, as it were, against it, was constructed a rude hut, built chiefly
      of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest, and secured
      against the weather by having its crevices stuffed with moss mingled with
      clay. The stem of a young fir-tree lopped of its branches, with a piece of
      wood tied across near the top, was planted upright by the door, as a rude
      emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on the right hand, a
      fountain of the purest water trickled out of the rock, and was received in
      a hollow stone, which labour had formed into a rustic basin. Escaping from
      thence, the stream murmured down the descent by a channel which its course
      had long worn, and so wandered through the little plain to lose itself in
      the neighbouring wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel, of which the
      roof had partly fallen in. The building, when entire, had never been above
      sixteen feet long by twelve feet in breadth, and the roof, low in
      proportion, rested upon four concentric arches which sprung from the four
      corners of the building, each supported upon a short and heavy pillar. The
      ribs of two of these arches remained, though the roof had fallen down
      betwixt them; over the others it remained entire. The entrance to this
      ancient place of devotion was under a very low round arch, ornamented by
      several courses of that zig-zag moulding, resembling shark's teeth, which
      appears so often in the more ancient Saxon architecture. A belfry rose
      above the porch on four small pillars, within which hung the green and
      weatherbeaten bell, the feeble sounds of which had been some time before
      heard by the Black Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before the
      eyes of the traveller, giving him good assurance of lodging for the night;
      since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in the woods, to
      exercise hospitality towards benighted or bewildered passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the particulars
      which we have detailed, but thanking Saint Julian (the patron of
      travellers) who had sent him good harbourage, he leaped from his horse and
      assailed the door of the hermitage with the butt of his lance, in order to
      arouse attention and gain admittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before he obtained any answer, and the reply, when made,
      was unpropitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass on, whosoever thou art,&rdquo; was the answer given by a deep hoarse voice
      from within the hut, &ldquo;and disturb not the servant of God and St Dunstan in
      his evening devotions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy father,&rdquo; answered the knight, &ldquo;here is a poor wanderer bewildered
      in these woods, who gives thee the opportunity of exercising thy charity
      and hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good brother,&rdquo; replied the inhabitant of the hermitage, &ldquo;it has pleased
      Our Lady and St Dunstan to destine me for the object of those virtues,
      instead of the exercise thereof. I have no provisions here which even a
      dog would share with me, and a horse of any tenderness of nurture would
      despise my couch&mdash;pass therefore on thy way, and God speed thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;is it possible for me to find my way
      through such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on? I pray you,
      reverend father as you are a Christian, to undo your door, and at least
      point out to me my road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I pray you, good Christian brother,&rdquo; replied the anchorite, &ldquo;to
      disturb me no more. You have already interrupted one 'pater', two 'aves',
      and a 'credo', which I, miserable sinner that I am, should, according to
      my vow, have said before moonrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road&mdash;the road!&rdquo; vociferated the knight, &ldquo;give me directions for
      the road, if I am to expect no more from thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road,&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;is easy to hit. The path from the wood
      leads to a morass, and from thence to a ford, which, as the rains have
      abated, may now be passable. When thou hast crossed the ford, thou wilt
      take care of thy footing up the left bank, as it is somewhat precipitous;
      and the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as I learn, (for I
      seldom leave the duties of my chapel,) given way in sundry places. Thou
      wilt then keep straight forward&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A broken path&mdash;a precipice&mdash;a ford, and a morass!&rdquo; said the
      knight interrupting him,&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Hermit, if you were the holiest that
      ever wore beard or told bead, you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this
      road to-night. I tell thee, that thou, who livest by the charity of the
      country&mdash;ill deserved, as I doubt it is&mdash;hast no right to refuse
      shelter to the wayfarer when in distress. Either open the door quickly,
      or, by the rood, I will beat it down and make entry for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend wayfarer,&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;be not importunate; if thou
      puttest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, it will be e'en
      the worse for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a distant noise of barking and growling, which the
      traveller had for some time heard, became extremely loud and furious, and
      made the knight suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of making
      forcible entry, had called the dogs who made this clamour to aid him in
      his defence, out of some inner recess in which they had been kennelled.
      Incensed at this preparation on the hermit's part for making good his
      inhospitable purpose, the knight struck the door so furiously with his
      foot, that posts as well as staples shook with violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anchorite, not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock, now
      called out aloud, &ldquo;Patience, patience&mdash;spare thy strength, good
      traveller, and I will presently undo the door, though, it may be, my doing
      so will be little to thy pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door accordingly was opened; and the hermit, a large, strong-built
      man, in his sackcloth gown and hood, girt with a rope of rushes, stood
      before the knight. He had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in the
      other a baton of crab-tree, so thick and heavy, that it might well be
      termed a club. Two large shaggy dogs, half greyhound half mastiff, stood
      ready to rush upon the traveller as soon as the door should be opened. But
      when the torch glanced upon the lofty crest and golden spurs of the
      knight, who stood without, the hermit, altering probably his original
      intentions, repressed the rage of his auxiliaries, and, changing his tone
      to a sort of churlish courtesy, invited the knight to enter his hut,
      making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge after sunset, by
      alleging the multitude of robbers and outlaws who were abroad, and who
      gave no honour to Our Lady or St Dunstan, nor to those holy men who spent
      life in their service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poverty of your cell, good father,&rdquo; said the knight, looking around
      him, and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves, a crucifix rudely carved in
      oak, a missal, with a rough-hewn table and two stools, and one or two
      clumsy articles of furniture&mdash;&ldquo;the poverty of your cell should seem a
      sufficient defence against any risk of thieves, not to mention the aid of
      two trusty dogs, large and strong enough, I think, to pull down a stag,
      and of course, to match with most men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good keeper of the forest,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;hath allowed me the use
      of these animals, to protect my solitude until the times shall mend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having said this, he fixed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which
      served for a candlestick; and, placing the oaken trivet before the embers
      of the fire, which he refreshed with some dry wood, he placed a stool upon
      one side of the table, and beckoned to the knight to do the same upon the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down, and gazed with great gravity at each other, each thinking
      in his heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or more athletic figure
      than was placed opposite to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend hermit,&rdquo; said the knight, after looking long and fixedly at his
      host, &ldquo;were it not to interrupt your devout meditations, I would pray to
      know three things of your holiness; first, where I am to put my horse?&mdash;secondly,
      what I can have for supper?&mdash;thirdly, where I am to take up my couch
      for the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will reply to you,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;with my finger, it being against
      my rule to speak by words where signs can answer the purpose.&rdquo; So saying,
      he pointed successively to two corners of the hut. &ldquo;Your stable,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;is there&mdash;your bed there; and,&rdquo; reaching down a platter with two
      handfuls of parched pease upon it from the neighbouring shelf, and placing
      it upon the table, he added, &ldquo;your supper is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight shrugged his shoulders, and leaving the hut, brought in his
      horse, (which in the interim he had fastened to a tree,) unsaddled him
      with much attention, and spread upon the steed's weary back his own
      mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety as
      well as address which the stranger displayed in tending his horse; for,
      muttering something about provender left for the keeper's palfrey, he
      dragged out of a recess a bundle of forage, which he spread before the
      knight's charger, and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity of
      dried fern in the corner which he had assigned for the rider's couch. The
      knight returned him thanks for his courtesy; and, this duty done, both
      resumed their seats by the table, whereon stood the trencher of pease
      placed between them. The hermit, after a long grace, which had once been
      Latin, but of which original language few traces remained, excepting here
      and there the long rolling termination of some word or phrase, set example
      to his guest, by modestly putting into a very large mouth, furnished with
      teeth which might have ranked with those of a boar both in sharpness and
      whiteness, some three or four dried pease, a miserable grist as it seemed
      for so large and able a mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight, in order to follow so laudable an example, laid aside his
      helmet, his corslet, and the greater part of his armour, and showed to the
      hermit a head thick-curled with yellow hair, high features, blue eyes,
      remarkably bright and sparkling, a mouth well formed, having an upper lip
      clothed with mustachoes darker than his hair, and bearing altogether the
      look of a bold, daring, and enterprising man, with which his strong form
      well corresponded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit, as if wishing to answer to the confidence of his guest, threw
      back his cowl, and showed a round bullet head belonging to a man in the
      prime of life. His close-shaven crown, surrounded by a circle of stiff
      curled black hair, had something the appearance of a parish pinfold begirt
      by its high hedge. The features expressed nothing of monastic austerity,
      or of ascetic privations; on the contrary, it was a bold bluff
      countenance, with broad black eyebrows, a well-turned forehead, and cheeks
      as round and vermilion as those of a trumpeter, from which descended a
      long and curly black beard. Such a visage, joined to the brawny form of
      the holy man, spoke rather of sirloins and haunches, than of pease and
      pulse. This incongruity did not escape the guest. After he had with great
      difficulty accomplished the mastication of a mouthful of the dried pease,
      he found it absolutely necessary to request his pious entertainer to
      furnish him with some liquor; who replied to his request by placing before
      him a large can of the purest water from the fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is from the well of St Dunstan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in which, betwixt sun and
      sun, he baptized five hundred heathen Danes and Britons&mdash;blessed be
      his name!&rdquo; And applying his black beard to the pitcher, he took a draught
      much more moderate in quantity than his encomium seemed to warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, reverend father,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;that the small
      morsels which you eat, together with this holy, but somewhat thin
      beverage, have thriven with you marvellously. You appear a man more fit to
      win the ram at a wrestling match, or the ring at a bout at quarter-staff,
      or the bucklers at a sword-play, than to linger out your time in this
      desolate wilderness, saying masses, and living upon parched pease and cold
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the hermit, &ldquo;your thoughts, like those of the
      ignorant laity, are according to the flesh. It has pleased Our Lady and my
      patron saint to bless the pittance to which I restrain myself, even as the
      pulse and water was blessed to the children Shadrach, Meshech, and
      Abednego, who drank the same rather than defile themselves with the wine
      and meats which were appointed them by the King of the Saracens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy father,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;upon whose countenance it hath pleased
      Heaven to work such a miracle, permit a sinful layman to crave thy name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou mayst call me,&rdquo; answered the hermit, &ldquo;the Clerk of Copmanhurst, for
      so I am termed in these parts&mdash;They add, it is true, the epithet
      holy, but I stand not upon that, as being unworthy of such addition.&mdash;And
      now, valiant knight, may I pray ye for the name of my honourable guest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, men call me in these
      parts the Black Knight,&mdash;many, sir, add to it the epithet of
      Sluggard, whereby I am no way ambitious to be distinguished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guest's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Sir Sluggish Knight, that thou art a man of prudence
      and of counsel; and moreover, I see that my poor monastic fare likes thee
      not, accustomed, perhaps, as thou hast been, to the license of courts and
      of camps, and the luxuries of cities; and now I bethink me, Sir Sluggard,
      that when the charitable keeper of this forest-walk left those dogs for my
      protection, and also those bundles of forage, he left me also some food,
      which, being unfit for my use, the very recollection of it had escaped me
      amid my more weighty meditations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare be sworn he did so,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;I was convinced that there
      was better food in the cell, Holy Clerk, since you first doffed your cowl.&mdash;Your
      keeper is ever a jovial fellow; and none who beheld thy grinders
      contending with these pease, and thy throat flooded with this ungenial
      element, could see thee doomed to such horse-provender and
      horse-beverage,&rdquo; (pointing to the provisions upon the table,) &ldquo;and refrain
      from mending thy cheer. Let us see the keeper's bounty, therefore, without
      delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hermit cast a wistful look upon the knight, in which there was a sort
      of comic expression of hesitation, as if uncertain how far he should act
      prudently in trusting his guest. There was, however, as much of bold
      frankness in the knight's countenance as was possible to be expressed by
      features. His smile, too, had something in it irresistibly comic, and gave
      an assurance of faith and loyalty, with which his host could not refrain
      from sympathizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After exchanging a mute glance or two, the hermit went to the further side
      of the hut, and opened a hutch, which was concealed with great care and
      some ingenuity. Out of the recesses of a dark closet, into which this
      aperture gave admittance, he brought a large pasty, baked in a pewter
      platter of unusual dimensions. This mighty dish he placed before his
      guest, who, using his poniard to cut it open, lost no time in making
      himself acquainted with its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is it since the good keeper has been here?&rdquo; said the knight to
      his host, after having swallowed several hasty morsels of this
      reinforcement to the hermit's good cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two months,&rdquo; answered the father hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the true Lord,&rdquo; answered the knight, &ldquo;every thing in your hermitage is
      miraculous, Holy Clerk! for I would have been sworn that the fat buck
      which furnished this venison had been running on foot within the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hermit was somewhat discountenanced by this observation; and,
      moreover, he made but a poor figure while gazing on the diminution of the
      pasty, on which his guest was making desperate inroads; a warfare in which
      his previous profession of abstinence left him no pretext for joining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been in Palestine, Sir Clerk,&rdquo; said the knight, stopping short of
      a sudden, &ldquo;and I bethink me it is a custom there that every host who
      entertains a guest shall assure him of the wholesomeness of his food, by
      partaking of it along with him. Far be it from me to suspect so holy a man
      of aught inhospitable; nevertheless I will be highly bound to you would
      you comply with this Eastern custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ease your unnecessary scruples, Sir Knight, I will for once depart
      from my rule,&rdquo; replied the hermit. And as there were no forks in those
      days, his clutches were instantly in the bowels of the pasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ice of ceremony being once broken, it seemed matter of rivalry between
      the guest and the entertainer which should display the best appetite; and
      although the former had probably fasted longest, yet the hermit fairly
      surpassed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Clerk,&rdquo; said the knight, when his hunger was appeased, &ldquo;I would gage
      my good horse yonder against a zecchin, that that same honest keeper to
      whom we are obliged for the venison has left thee a stoup of wine, or a
      runlet of canary, or some such trifle, by way of ally to this noble pasty.
      This would be a circumstance, doubtless, totally unworthy to dwell in the
      memory of so rigid an anchorite; yet, I think, were you to search yonder
      crypt once more, you would find that I am right in my conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hermit only replied by a grin; and returning to the hutch, he produced
      a leathern bottle, which might contain about four quarts. He also brought
      forth two large drinking cups, made out of the horn of the urus, and
      hooped with silver. Having made this goodly provision for washing down the
      supper, he seemed to think no farther ceremonious scruple necessary on his
      part; but filling both cups, and saying, in the Saxon fashion, &ldquo;'Waes
      hael', Sir Sluggish Knight!&rdquo; he emptied his own at a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Drink hael', Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst!&rdquo; answered the warrior, and did
      his host reason in a similar brimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Clerk,&rdquo; said the stranger, after the first cup was thus swallowed,
      &ldquo;I cannot but marvel that a man possessed of such thews and sinews as
      thine, and who therewithal shows the talent of so goodly a trencher-man,
      should think of abiding by himself in this wilderness. In my judgment, you
      are fitter to keep a castle or a fort, eating of the fat and drinking of
      the strong, than to live here upon pulse and water, or even upon the
      charity of the keeper. At least, were I as thou, I should find myself both
      disport and plenty out of the king's deer. There is many a goodly herd in
      these forests, and a buck will never be missed that goes to the use of
      Saint Dunstan's chaplain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Sluggish Knight,&rdquo; replied the Clerk, &ldquo;these are dangerous words, and
      I pray you to forbear them. I am true hermit to the king and law, and were
      I to spoil my liege's game, I should be sure of the prison, and, an my
      gown saved me not, were in some peril of hanging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, were I as thou,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;I would take my walk by
      moonlight, when foresters and keepers were warm in bed, and ever and anon,&mdash;as
      I pattered my prayers,&mdash;I would let fly a shaft among the herds of
      dun deer that feed in the glades&mdash;Resolve me, Holy Clerk, hast thou
      never practised such a pastime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Sluggard,&rdquo; answered the hermit, &ldquo;thou hast seen all that can
      concern thee of my housekeeping, and something more than he deserves who
      takes up his quarters by violence. Credit me, it is better to enjoy the
      good which God sends thee, than to be impertinently curious how it comes.
      Fill thy cup, and welcome; and do not, I pray thee, by further impertinent
      enquiries, put me to show that thou couldst hardly have made good thy
      lodging had I been earnest to oppose thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;thou makest me more curious than ever!
      Thou art the most mysterious hermit I ever met; and I will know more of
      thee ere we part. As for thy threats, know, holy man, thou speakest to one
      whose trade it is to find out danger wherever it is to be met with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Sluggish Knight, I drink to thee,&rdquo; said the hermit; &ldquo;respecting thy
      valour much, but deeming wondrous slightly of thy discretion. If thou wilt
      take equal arms with me, I will give thee, in all friendship and brotherly
      love, such sufficing penance and complete absolution, that thou shalt not
      for the next twelve months sin the sin of excess of curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight pledged him, and desired him to name his weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none,&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;from the scissors of Delilah, and
      the tenpenny nail of Jael, to the scimitar of Goliath, at which I am not a
      match for thee&mdash;But, if I am to make the election, what sayst thou,
      good friend, to these trinkets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, he opened another hutch, and took out from it a couple of
      broadswords and bucklers, such as were used by the yeomanry of the period.
      The knight, who watched his motions, observed that this second place of
      concealment was furnished with two or three good long-bows, a cross-bow, a
      bundle of bolts for the latter, and half-a-dozen sheaves of arrows for the
      former. A harp, and other matters of a very uncanonical appearance, were
      also visible when this dark recess was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise thee, brother Clerk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will ask thee no more
      offensive questions. The contents of that cupboard are an answer to all my
      enquiries; and I see a weapon there&rdquo; (here he stooped and took out the
      harp) &ldquo;on which I would more gladly prove my skill with thee, than at the
      sword and buckler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;thou hast given no good reason for
      thy surname of the Sluggard. I do promise thee I suspect thee grievously.
      Nevertheless, thou art my guest, and I will not put thy manhood to the
      proof without thine own free will. Sit thee down, then, and fill thy cup;
      let us drink, sing, and be merry. If thou knowest ever a good lay, thou
      shalt be welcome to a nook of pasty at Copmanhurst so long as I serve the
      chapel of St Dunstan, which, please God, shall be till I change my grey
      covering for one of green turf. But come, fill a flagon, for it will crave
      some time to tune the harp; and nought pitches the voice and sharpens the
      ear like a cup of wine. For my part, I love to feel the grape at my very
      finger-ends before they make the harp-strings tinkle.&rdquo; <a

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     At eve, within yon studious nook,
     I ope my brass-embossed book,
     Portray'd with many a holy deed
     Of martyrs crown'd with heavenly meed;
     Then, as my taper waxes dim,
     Chant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn.
</pre>
    <hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Who but would cast his pomp away,
     To take my staff and amice grey,
     And to the world's tumultuous stage,
     Prefer the peaceful Hermitage?
     &mdash;Warton
</pre>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his
      guest willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bring the harp to
      harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks, holy father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the instrument wants one string, and
      the rest have been somewhat misused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, mark'st thou that?&rdquo; replied the hermit; &ldquo;that shows thee a master of
      the craft. Wine and wassail,&rdquo; he added, gravely casting up his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;all
      the fault of wine and wassail!&mdash;I told Allan-a-Dale, the northern
      minstrel, that he would damage the harp if he touched it after the seventh
      cup, but he would not be controlled&mdash;Friend, I drink to thy
      successful performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he took off his cup with much gravity, at the same time shaking
      his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight in the meantime, had brought the strings into some order, and
      after a short prelude, asked his host whether he would choose a &ldquo;sirvente&rdquo;
       in the language of &ldquo;oc&rdquo;, or a &ldquo;lai&rdquo; in the language of &ldquo;oui&rdquo;, or a
      &ldquo;virelai&rdquo;, or a ballad in the vulgar English. <a href="#linknote-23"      name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23"><small>23</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ballad, a ballad,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;against all the 'ocs' and 'ouis'
      of France. Downright English am I, Sir Knight, and downright English was
      my patron St Dunstan, and scorned 'oc' and 'oui', as he would have scorned
      the parings of the devil's hoof&mdash;downright English alone shall be
      sung in this cell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will assay, then,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;a ballad composed by a Saxon
      glee-man, whom I knew in Holy Land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It speedily appeared, that if the knight was not a complete master of the
      minstrel art, his taste for it had at least been cultivated under the best
      instructors. Art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice which had
      little compass, and was naturally rough rather than mellow, and, in short,
      had done all that culture can do in supplying natural deficiencies. His
      performance, therefore, might have been termed very respectable by abler
      judges than the hermit, especially as the knight threw into the notes now
      a degree of spirit, and now of plaintive enthusiasm, which gave force and
      energy to the verses which he sung.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     THE CRUSADER'S RETURN.

     1.

     High deeds achieved of knightly fame,
     From Palestine the champion came;
     The cross upon his shoulders borne,
     Battle and blast had dimm'd and torn.
     Each dint upon his batter'd shield
     Was token of a foughten field;
     And thus, beneath his lady's bower,
     He sung as fell the twilight hour:&mdash;

     2.

     &ldquo;Joy to the fair!&mdash;thy knight behold,
     Return'd from yonder land of gold;
     No wealth he brings, nor wealth can need,
     Save his good arms and battle-steed
     His spurs, to dash against a foe,
     His lance and sword to lay him low;
     Such all the trophies of his toil,
     Such&mdash;and the hope of Tekla's smile!

     3.

     &ldquo;Joy to the fair! whose constant knight
     Her favour fired to feats of might;
     Unnoted shall she not remain,
     Where meet the bright and noble train;
     Minstrel shall sing and herald tell&mdash;
     'Mark yonder maid of beauty well,
     'Tis she for whose bright eyes were won
     The listed field at Askalon!

     4.

     &ldquo;'Note well her smile!&mdash;it edged the blade
     Which fifty wives to widows made,
     When, vain his strength and Mahound's spell,
     Iconium's turban'd Soldan fell.
     Seest thou her locks, whose sunny glow
     Half shows, half shades, her neck of snow?
     Twines not of them one golden thread,
     But for its sake a Paynim bled.'

     5.

     &ldquo;Joy to the fair!&mdash;my name unknown,
     Each deed, and all its praise thine own
     Then, oh! unbar this churlish gate,
     The night dew falls, the hour is late.
     Inured to Syria's glowing breath,
     I feel the north breeze chill as death;
     Let grateful love quell maiden shame,
     And grant him bliss who brings thee fame.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      During this performance, the hermit demeaned himself much like a
      first-rate critic of the present day at a new opera. He reclined back upon
      his seat, with his eyes half shut; now, folding his hands and twisting his
      thumbs, he seemed absorbed in attention, and anon, balancing his expanded
      palms, he gently flourished them in time to the music. At one or two
      favourite cadences, he threw in a little assistance of his own, where the
      knight's voice seemed unable to carry the air so high as his worshipful
      taste approved. When the song was ended, the anchorite emphatically
      declared it a good one, and well sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think my Saxon countrymen had herded long enough
      with the Normans, to fall into the tone of their melancholy ditties. What
      took the honest knight from home? or what could he expect but to find his
      mistress agreeably engaged with a rival on his return, and his serenade,
      as they call it, as little regarded as the caterwauling of a cat in the
      gutter? Nevertheless, Sir Knight, I drink this cup to thee, to the success
      of all true lovers&mdash;I fear you are none,&rdquo; he added, on observing that
      the knight (whose brain began to be heated with these repeated draughts)
      qualified his flagon from the water pitcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;did you not tell me that this water was from the
      well of your blessed patron, St Dunstan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, truly,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;and many a hundred of pagans did he baptize
      there, but I never heard that he drank any of it. Every thing should be
      put to its proper use in this world. St Dunstan knew, as well as any one,
      the prerogatives of a jovial friar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with the
      following characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus, appropriate
      to an old English ditty. <a href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24"       id="linknoteref-24"><small>24</small></a>

     THE BAREFOOTED FRIAR.

     1.

     I'll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain,
     To search Europe through, from Byzantium to Spain;
     But ne'er shall you find, should you search till you tire,
     So happy a man as the Barefooted Friar.

     2.

     Your knight for his lady pricks forth in career,
     And is brought home at even-song prick'd through with a spear;
     I confess him in haste&mdash;for his lady desires
     No comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friar's.

     3.

     Your monarch?&mdash;Pshaw! many a prince has been known
     To barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,
     But which of us e'er felt the idle desire
     To exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar!

     4.

     The Friar has walk'd out, and where'er he has gone,
     The land and its fatness is mark'd for his own;
     He can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires,
     For every man's house is the Barefooted Friar's.

     5.

     He's expected at noon, and no wight till he comes
     May profane the great chair, or the porridge of plums
     For the best of the cheer, and the seat by the fire,
     Is the undenied right of the Barefooted Friar.

     6.

     He's expected at night, and the pasty's made hot,
     They broach the brown ale, and they fill the black pot,
     And the goodwife would wish the goodman in the mire,
     Ere he lack'd a soft pillow, the Barefooted Friar.

     7.

     Long flourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope,
     The dread of the devil and trust of the Pope;
     For to gather life's roses, unscathed by the briar,
     Is granted alone to the Barefooted Friar.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my troth,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;thou hast sung well and lustily, and in
      high praise of thine order. And, talking of the devil, Holy Clerk, are you
      not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your uncanonical
      pastimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I uncanonical!&rdquo; answered the hermit; &ldquo;I scorn the charge&mdash;I scorn it
      with my heels!&mdash;I serve the duty of my chapel duly and truly&mdash;Two
      masses daily, morning and evening, primes, noons, and vespers, 'aves,
      credos, paters'&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excepting moonlight nights, when the venison is in season,&rdquo; said his
      guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Exceptis excipiendis'&rdquo; replied the hermit, &ldquo;as our old abbot taught me
      to say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if I kept every punctilio of
      mine order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, holy father,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;but the devil is apt to keep an eye
      on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like a roaring lion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him roar here if he dares,&rdquo; said the friar; &ldquo;a touch of my cord will
      make him roar as loud as the tongs of St Dunstan himself did. I never
      feared man, and I as little fear the devil and his imps. Saint Dunstan,
      Saint Dubric, Saint Winibald, Saint Winifred, Saint Swibert, Saint
      Willick, not forgetting Saint Thomas a Kent, and my own poor merits to
      speed, I defy every devil of them, come cut and long tail.&mdash;But to
      let you into a secret, I never speak upon such subjects, my friend, until
      after morning vespers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He changed the conversation; fast and furious grew the mirth of the
      parties, and many a song was exchanged betwixt them, when their revels
      were interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the
      adventures of another set of our characters; for, like old Ariosto, we do
      not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with any one
      personage of our drama.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Away! our journey lies through dell and dingle,
     Where the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother,
     Where the broad oak, with intercepting boughs,
     Chequers the sunbeam in the green-sward alley&mdash;
     Up and away!&mdash;for lovely paths are these
     To tread, when the glad Sun is on his throne
     Less pleasant, and less safe, when Cynthia's lamp
     With doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest.
     &mdash;Ettrick Forest
</pre>
    <p>
      When Cedric the Saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at
      Ashby, his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of his
      own attendants, but the words choked in his throat. He could not bring
      himself to acknowledge, in presence of such an assembly, the son whom he
      had renounced and disinherited. He ordered, however, Oswald to keep an eye
      upon him; and directed that officer, with two of his serfs, to convey
      Ivanhoe to Ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. Oswald, however, was
      anticipated in this good office. The crowd dispersed, indeed, but the
      knight was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Cedric's cupbearer looked around for his young master&mdash;he
      saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but himself he saw
      no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him from the spot.
      Perhaps Oswald (for the Saxons were very superstitious) might have adopted
      some such hypothesis, to account for Ivanhoe's disappearance, had he not
      suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired like a squire, in whom he
      recognised the features of his fellow-servant Gurth. Anxious concerning
      his master's fate, and in despair at his sudden disappearance, the
      translated swineherd was searching for him everywhere, and had neglected,
      in doing so, the concealment on which his own safety depended. Oswald
      deemed it his duty to secure Gurth, as a fugitive of whose fate his master
      was to judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of Ivanhoe, the only
      information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders was,
      that the knight had been raised with care by certain well-attired grooms,
      and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators, which had
      immediately transported him out of the press. Oswald, on receiving this
      intelligence, resolved to return to his master for farther instructions,
      carrying along with him Gurth, whom he considered in some sort as a
      deserter from the service of Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions
      concerning his son; for Nature had asserted her rights, in spite of the
      patriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her. But no sooner was he
      informed that Ivanhoe was in careful, and probably in friendly hands, than
      the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his fate,
      gave way anew to the feeling of injured pride and resentment, at what he
      termed Wilfred's filial disobedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him wander his way,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;let those leech his wounds for
      whose sake he encountered them. He is fitter to do the juggling tricks of
      the Norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his English
      ancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the good old weapons of his
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If to maintain the honour of ancestry,&rdquo; said Rowena, who was present, &ldquo;it
      is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in execution&mdash;to be
      boldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, I know no voice,
      save his father's&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, Lady Rowena!&mdash;on this subject only I hear you not.
      Prepare yourself for the Prince's festival: we have been summoned thither
      with unwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty
      Normans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of Hastings.
      Thither will I go, were it only to show these proud Normans how little the
      fate of a son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a Saxon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thither,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;do I NOT go; and I pray you to beware, lest what
      you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accounted hardness of heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain at home, then, ungrateful lady,&rdquo; answered Cedric; &ldquo;thine is the
      hard heart, which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed people to an idle
      and unauthorized attachment. I seek the noble Athelstane, and with him
      attend the banquet of John of Anjou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned the
      principal events. Immediately upon retiring from the castle, the Saxon
      thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the bustle
      which attended their doing so, that Cedric, for the first time, cast his
      eyes upon the deserter Gurth. The noble Saxon had returned from the
      banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted but a
      pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gyves!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the gyves!&mdash;Oswald&mdash;Hundibert!&mdash;Dogs
      and villains!&mdash;why leave ye the knave unfettered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without daring to remonstrate, the companions of Gurth bound him with a
      halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. He submitted to the operation
      without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful look at his
      master, he said, &ldquo;This comes of loving your flesh and blood better than
      mine own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To horse, and forward!&rdquo; said Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed full time,&rdquo; said the noble Athelstane; &ldquo;for, if we ride not
      the faster, the worthy Abbot Waltheoff's preparations for a rere-supper <a
      href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
      will be altogether spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of St
      Withold's before the apprehended evil took place. The Abbot, himself of
      ancient Saxon descent, received the noble Saxons with the profuse and
      exuberant hospitality of their nation, wherein they indulged to a late, or
      rather an early hour; nor did they take leave of their reverend host the
      next morning until they had shared with him a sumptuous refection.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cavalcade left the court of the monastery, an incident happened
      somewhat alarming to the Saxons, who, of all people of Europe, were most
      addicted to a superstitious observance of omens, and to whose opinions can
      be traced most of those notions upon such subjects, still to be found
      among our popular antiquities. For the Normans being a mixed race, and
      better informed according to the information of the times, had lost most
      of the superstitious prejudices which their ancestors had brought from
      Scandinavia, and piqued themselves upon thinking freely on such topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired
      by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog, which,
      sitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the
      gate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to and fro,
      seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like not that music, father Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane; for by this title
      of respect he was accustomed to address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I either, uncle,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;I greatly fear we shall have to pay
      the piper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my mind,&rdquo; said Athelstane, upon whose memory the Abbot's good ale (for
      Burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a favourable
      impression,&mdash;&ldquo;in my mind we had better turn back, and abide with the
      Abbot until the afternoon. It is unlucky to travel where your path is
      crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have eaten your
      next meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away!&rdquo; said Cedric, impatiently; &ldquo;the day is already too short for our
      journey. For the dog, I know it to be the cur of the runaway slave Gurth,
      a useless fugitive like its master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at the
      interruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poor Fangs&mdash;for
      Fangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his stolen
      expedition, had here lost him, and was now, in his uncouth way, rejoicing
      at his reappearance. The javelin inflicted a wound upon the animal's
      shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth; and Fangs fled
      howling from the presence of the enraged thane. Gurth's heart swelled
      within him; for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful adherent
      in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself received.
      Having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his eyes, he said to Wamba,
      who, seeing his master's ill humour had prudently retreated to the rear,
      &ldquo;I pray thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes with the skirt of thy
      mantle; the dust offends me, and these bonds will not let me help myself
      one way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for some
      time, during which Gurth maintained a moody silence. At length he could
      repress his feelings no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Wamba,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of all those who are fools enough to serve
      Cedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable to
      him. Go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor fear
      will Gurth serve him longer. He may strike the head from me&mdash;he may
      scourge me&mdash;he may load me with irons&mdash;but henceforth he shall
      never compel me either to love or to obey him. Go to him, then, and tell
      him that Gurth the son of Beowulph renounces his service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;fool as I am, I shall not do your fool's errand.
      Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou knowest he
      does not always miss his mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;how soon he makes a mark of me. Yesterday he
      left Wilfred, my young master, in his blood. To-day he has striven to kill
      before my face the only other living creature that ever showed me
      kindness. By St Edmund, St Dunstan, St Withold, St Edward the Confessor,
      and every other Saxon saint in the calendar,&rdquo; (for Cedric never swore by
      any that was not of Saxon lineage, and all his household had the same
      limited devotion,) &ldquo;I will never forgive him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my thinking now,&rdquo; said the Jester, who was frequently wont to act as
      peace-maker in the family, &ldquo;our master did not propose to hurt Fangs, but
      only to affright him. For, if you observed, he rose in his stirrups, as
      thereby meaning to overcast the mark; and so he would have done, but Fangs
      happening to bound up at the very moment, received a scratch, which I will
      be bound to heal with a penny's breadth of tar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought so,&rdquo; said Gurth&mdash;&ldquo;if I could but think so&mdash;but no&mdash;I
      saw the javelin was well aimed&mdash;I heard it whizz through the air with
      all the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it
      had pitched in the ground, as if with regret for having missed its mark.
      By the hog dear to St Anthony, I renounce him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts
      of the Jester could again induce him to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Cedric and Athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed
      together on the state of the land, on the dissensions of the royal family,
      on the feuds and quarrels among the Norman nobles, and on the chance which
      there was that the oppressed Saxons might be able to free themselves from
      the yoke of the Normans, or at least to elevate themselves into national
      consequence and independence, during the civil convulsions which were
      likely to ensue. On this subject Cedric was all animation. The restoration
      of the independence of his race was the idol of his heart, to which he had
      willingly sacrificed domestic happiness and the interests of his own son.
      But, in order to achieve this great revolution in favour of the native
      English, it was necessary that they should be united among themselves, and
      act under an acknowledged head. The necessity of choosing their chief from
      the Saxon blood-royal was not only evident in itself, but had been made a
      solemn condition by those whom Cedric had intrusted with his secret plans
      and hopes. Athelstane had this quality at least; and though he had few
      mental accomplishments or talents to recommend him as a leader, he had
      still a goodly person, was no coward, had been accustomed to martial
      exercises, and seemed willing to defer to the advice of counsellors more
      wise than himself. Above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable,
      and believed to be good-natured. But whatever pretensions Athelstane had
      to be considered as head of the Saxon confederacy, many of that nation
      were disposed to prefer to the title of the Lady Rowena, who drew her
      descent from Alfred, and whose father having been a chief renowned for
      wisdom, courage, and generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his
      oppressed countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been no difficult thing for Cedric, had he been so disposed,
      to have placed himself at the head of a third party, as formidable at
      least as any of the others. To counterbalance their royal descent, he had
      courage, activity, energy, and, above all, that devoted attachment to the
      cause which had procured him the epithet of The Saxon, and his birth was
      inferior to none, excepting only that of Athelstane and his ward. These
      qualities, however, were unalloyed by the slightest shade of selfishness;
      and, instead of dividing yet farther his weakened nation by forming a
      faction of his own, it was a leading part of Cedric's plan to extinguish
      that which already existed, by promoting a marriage betwixt Rowena and
      Athelstane. An obstacle occurred to this his favourite project, in the
      mutual attachment of his ward and his son and hence the original cause of
      the banishment of Wilfred from the house of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stern measure Cedric had adopted, in hopes that, during Wilfred's
      absence, Rowena might relinquish her preference, but in this hope he was
      disappointed; a disappointment which might be attributed in part to the
      mode in which his ward had been educated. Cedric, to whom the name of
      Alfred was as that of a deity, had treated the sole remaining scion of
      that great monarch with a degree of observance, such as, perhaps, was in
      those days scarce paid to an acknowledged princess. Rowena's will had been
      in almost all cases a law to his household; and Cedric himself, as if
      determined that her sovereignty should be fully acknowledged within that
      little circle at least, seemed to take a pride in acting as the first of
      her subjects. Thus trained in the exercise not only of free will, but
      despotic authority, Rowena was, by her previous education, disposed both
      to resist and to resent any attempt to control her affections, or dispose
      of her hand contrary to her inclinations, and to assert her independence
      in a case in which even those females who have been trained up to
      obedience and subjection, are not infrequently apt to dispute the
      authority of guardians and parents. The opinions which she felt strongly,
      she avowed boldly; and Cedric, who could not free himself from his
      habitual deference to her opinions, felt totally at a loss how to enforce
      his authority of guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a
      visionary throne. Rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered
      his plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned,
      could it have been achieved. Without attempting to conceal her avowed
      preference of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured
      knight out of question, she would rather take refuge in a convent, than
      share a throne with Athelstane, whom, having always despised, she now
      began, on account of the trouble she received on his account, thoroughly
      to detest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Cedric, whose opinions of women's constancy was far from
      strong, persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the
      proposed match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important
      service to the Saxon cause. The sudden and romantic appearance of his son
      in the lists at Ashby, he had justly regarded as almost a death's blow to
      his hopes. His paternal affection, it is true, had for an instant gained
      the victory over pride and patriotism; but both had returned in full
      force, and under their joint operation, he was now bent upon making a
      determined effort for the union of Athelstane and Rowena, together with
      expediting those other measures which seemed necessary to forward the
      restoration of Saxon independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this last subject, he was now labouring with Athelstane, not without
      having reason, every now and then, to lament, like Hotspur, that he should
      have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an action.
      Athelstane, it is true, was vain enough, and loved to have his ears
      tickled with tales of his high descent, and of his right by inheritance to
      homage and sovereignty. But his petty vanity was sufficiently gratified by
      receiving this homage at the hands of his immediate attendants, and of the
      Saxons who approached him. If he had the courage to encounter danger, he
      at least hated the trouble of going to seek it; and while he agreed in the
      general principles laid down by Cedric concerning the claim of the Saxons
      to independence, and was still more easily convinced of his own title to
      reign over them when that independence should be attained, yet when the
      means of asserting these rights came to be discussed, he was still
      &ldquo;Athelstane the Unready,&rdquo; slow, irresolute, procrastinating, and
      unenterprising. The warm and impassioned exhortations of Cedric had as
      little effect upon his impassive temper, as red-hot balls alighting in the
      water, which produce a little sound and smoke, and are instantly
      extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, leaving this task, which might be compared to spurring a tired jade,
      or to hammering upon cold iron, Cedric fell back to his ward Rowena, he
      received little more satisfaction from conferring with her. For, as his
      presence interrupted the discourse between the lady and her favourite
      attendant upon the gallantry and fate of Wilfred, Elgitha failed not to
      revenge both her mistress and herself, by recurring to the overthrow of
      Athelstane in the lists, the most disagreeable subject which could greet
      the ears of Cedric. To this sturdy Saxon, therefore, the day's journey was
      fraught with all manner of displeasure and discomfort; so that he more
      than once internally cursed the tournament, and him who had proclaimed it,
      together with his own folly in ever thinking of going thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, upon the motion of Athelstane, the travellers paused in a
      woodland shade by a fountain, to repose their horses and partake of some
      provisions, with which the hospitable Abbot had loaded a sumpter mule.
      Their repast was a pretty long one; and these several interruptions
      rendered it impossible for them to hope to reach Rotherwood without
      travelling all night, a conviction which induced them to proceed on their
      way at a more hasty pace than they had hitherto used.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A train of armed men, some noble dame
     Escorting, (so their scatter'd words discover'd,
     As unperceived I hung upon their rear,)
     Are close at hand, and mean to pass the night
     Within the castle.
     &mdash;Orra, a Tragedy
</pre>
    <p>
      The travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were
      about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the
      number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair, and
      who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid defiance
      to the feeble police of the period. From these rovers, however,
      notwithstanding the lateness of the hour Cedric and Athelstane accounted
      themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides Wamba
      and Gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester and
      the other a captive. It may be added, that in travelling thus late through
      the forest, Cedric and Athelstane relied on their descent and character,
      as well as their courage. The outlaws, whom the severity of the forest
      laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life, were chiefly
      peasants and yeomen of Saxon descent, and were generally supposed to
      respect the persons and property of their countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated
      cries for assistance; and when they rode up to the place from whence they
      came, they were surprised to find a horse-litter placed upon the ground,
      beside which sat a young woman, richly dressed in the Jewish fashion,
      while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong to the same
      nation, walked up and down with gestures expressive of the deepest
      despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the enquiries of Athelstane and Cedric, the old Jew could for some time
      only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the Old
      Testament successively against the sons of Ishmael, who were coming to
      smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. When he began to
      come to himself out of this agony of terror, Isaac of York (for it was our
      old friend) was at length able to explain, that he had hired a body-guard
      of six men at Ashby, together with mules for carrying the litter of a sick
      friend. This party had undertaken to escort him as far as Doncaster. They
      had come thus far in safety; but having received information from a
      wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws lying in wait in the
      woods before them, Isaac's mercenaries had not only taken flight, but had
      carried off with them the horses which bore the litter and left the Jew
      and his daughter without the means either of defence or of retreat, to be
      plundered, and probably murdered, by the banditti, who they expected every
      moment would bring down upon them. &ldquo;Would it but please your valours,&rdquo;
       added Isaac, in a tone of deep humiliation, &ldquo;to permit the poor Jews to
      travel under your safeguard, I swear by the tables of our law, that never
      has favour been conferred upon a child of Israel since the days of our
      captivity, which shall be more gratefully acknowledged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog of a Jew!&rdquo; said Athelstane, whose memory was of that petty kind which
      stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling offences, &ldquo;dost
      not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at the tilt-yard?
      Fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost list, ask neither
      aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such as thee, who rob all
      the world, I, for mine own share, shall hold them right honest folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. &ldquo;We shall
      do better,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to leave them two of our attendants and two horses
      to convey them back to the next village. It will diminish our strength but
      little; and with your good sword, noble Athelstane, and the aid of those
      who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those
      runagates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so near
      them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. But Rebecca suddenly
      quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the attendants
      to the palfrey of the Saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the Oriental
      fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of Rowena's garment. Then
      rising, and throwing back her veil, she implored her in the great name of
      the God whom they both worshipped, and by that revelation of the Law upon
      Mount Sinai, in which they both believed, that she would have compassion
      upon them, and suffer them to go forward under their safeguard. &ldquo;It is not
      for myself that I pray this favour,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;nor is it even for
      that poor old man. I know that to wrong and to spoil our nation is a light
      fault, if not a merit, with the Christians; and what is it to us whether
      it be done in the city, in the desert, or in the field? But it is in the
      name of one dear to many, and dear even to you, that I beseech you to let
      this sick person be transported with care and tenderness under your
      protection. For, if evil chance him, the last moment of your life would be
      embittered with regret for denying that which I ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noble and solemn air with which Rebecca made this appeal, gave it
      double weight with the fair Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is old and feeble,&rdquo; she said to her guardian, &ldquo;the maiden young
      and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life&mdash;Jews
      though they be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this extremity. Let
      them unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of
      the serfs. The mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for
      the old man and his daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and Athelstane only added
      the condition, &ldquo;that they should travel in the rear of the whole party,
      where Wamba,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might attend them with his shield of boar's
      brawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left my shield in the tilt-yard,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;as has
      been the fate of many a better knight than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the last day
      of the tournament; while Rowena, who was pleased in the same proportion,
      as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling suitor,
      requested Rebecca to ride by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were not fit I should do so,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, with proud humility,
      &ldquo;where my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single
      word &ldquo;outlaws&rdquo; rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach of
      twilight made the sound yet more impressive. Amid the bustle, Gurth was
      taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed upon the
      Jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. It was so
      negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of Wamba, that
      Gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from bondage, and
      then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before Gurth was
      missed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind a
      servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him
      under his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them that Gurth
      had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate expectation of an
      attack from the outlaws, that it was not held convenient to pay much
      attention to the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to
      admit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began
      to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken,
      swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. Cedric and Athelstane, who were
      at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at this pass;
      but neither of them having had much practice in war, no better mode of
      preventing the danger occurred to them than that they should hasten
      through the defile as fast as possible. Advancing, therefore, without much
      order, they had just crossed the brook with a part of their followers,
      when they were assailed in front, flank, and rear at once, with an
      impetuosity to which, in their confused and ill-prepared condition, it was
      impossible to offer effectual resistance. The shout of &ldquo;A white dragon!&mdash;a
      white dragon!&mdash;Saint George for merry England!&rdquo; war-cries adopted by
      the assailants, as belonging to their assumed character of Saxon outlaws,
      was heard on every side, and on every side enemies appeared with a
      rapidity of advance and attack which seemed to multiply their numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each
      under circumstances expressive of his character. Cedric, the instant that
      an enemy appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which, taking
      better effect than that which he had hurled at Fangs, nailed the man
      against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him. Thus far
      successful, Cedric spurred his horse against a second, drawing his sword
      at the same time, and striking with such inconsiderate fury, that his
      weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over him, and he was disarmed
      by the violence of his own blow. He was instantly made prisoner, and
      pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who crowded around
      him. Athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having been seized, and
      he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could draw his weapon, or
      assume any posture of effectual defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the
      fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while the Lady
      Rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the Jew and his daughter in
      the rear, experienced the same misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the train none escaped except Wamba, who showed upon the occasion
      much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense. He possessed
      himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was just drawing
      it with a tardy and irresolute hand, laid it about him like a lion, drove
      back several who approached him, and made a brave though ineffectual
      attempt to succour his master. Finding himself overpowered, the Jester at
      length threw himself from his horse, plunged into the thicket, and,
      favoured by the general confusion, escaped from the scene of action. Yet
      the valiant Jester, as soon as he found himself safe, hesitated more than
      once whether he should not turn back and share the captivity of a master
      to whom he was sincerely attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,&rdquo; he said to himself,
      &ldquo;but I wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that I
      have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in a
      low and cautious tone, &ldquo;Wamba!&rdquo; and, at the same time, a dog, which he
      recognised to be Fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. &ldquo;Gurth!&rdquo; answered
      Wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said he eagerly; &ldquo;what mean these cries, and that
      clashing of swords?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a trick of the times,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;they are all prisoners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are prisoners?&rdquo; exclaimed Gurth, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, and my lady, and Athelstane, and Hundibert, and Oswald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God!&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;how came they prisoners?&mdash;and to
      whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our master was too ready to fight,&rdquo; said the Jester; &ldquo;and Athelstane was
      not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. And they are
      prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. And they lie all tumbled
      about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your
      swine. And I would laugh at it,&rdquo; said the honest Jester, &ldquo;if I could for
      weeping.&rdquo; And he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gurth's countenance kindled&mdash;&ldquo;Wamba,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou hast a weapon,
      and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,&mdash;we are only two&mdash;but
      a sudden attack from men of resolution will do much&mdash;follow me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither?&mdash;and for what purpose?&rdquo; said the Jester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To rescue Cedric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have renounced his service but now,&rdquo; said Wamba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;was but while he was fortunate&mdash;follow me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his
      appearance, and commanded them both to halt. From his dress and arms,
      Wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just
      assailed his master; but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering
      baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it supported,
      as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice and manner,
      made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise Locksley the yeoman, who
      had been victorious, under such disadvantageous circumstances, in the
      contest for the prize of archery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of all this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or who is it that rifle, and
      ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may look at their cassocks close by,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;and see whether
      they be thy children's coats or no&mdash;for they are as like thine own,
      as one green pea-cod is to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will learn that presently,&rdquo; answered Locksley; &ldquo;and I charge ye, on
      peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until I
      have returned. Obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your
      masters.&mdash;Yet stay, I must render myself as like these men as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from his
      cap, and gave them to Wamba; then drew a vizard from his pouch, and,
      repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his purposes
      of reconnoitring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we stand fast, Gurth?&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;or shall we e'en give him
      leg-bail? In my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too much
      in readiness, to be himself a true man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be the devil,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;an he will. We can be no worse of
      waiting his return. If he belong to that party, he must already have given
      them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly. Besides,
      I have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst men in the
      world to have to deal with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Gurth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have mingled among yon men, and have learnt to
      whom they belong, and whither they are bound. There is, I think, no chance
      that they will proceed to any actual violence against their prisoners. For
      three men to attempt them at this moment, were little else than madness;
      for they are good men of war, and have, as such, placed sentinels to give
      the alarm when any one approaches. But I trust soon to gather such a
      force, as may act in defiance of all their precautions; you are both
      servants, and, as I think, faithful servants, of Cedric the Saxon, the
      friend of the rights of Englishmen. He shall not want English hands to
      help him in this extremity. Come then with me, until I gather more aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the
      jester and the swineherd. It was not consistent with Wamba's humour to
      travel long in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still
      carried, &ldquo;that I saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that not
      so long since as Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;could take it on my halidome, that I have heard the
      voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and that
      the moon is not three days older since I did so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine honest friends,&rdquo; replied the yeoman, &ldquo;who, or what I am, is little
      to the present purpose; should I free your master, you will have reason to
      think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. And whether I am
      known by one name or another&mdash;or whether I can draw a bow as well or
      better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to walk in sunshine
      or by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not concern you, so
      neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our heads are in the lion's mouth,&rdquo; said Wamba, in a whisper to Gurth,
      &ldquo;get them out how we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;be silent,&rdquo; said Gurth. &ldquo;Offend him not by thy folly, and I
      trust sincerely that all will go well.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When autumn nights were long and drear,
     And forest walks were dark and dim,
     How sweetly on the pilgrim's ear
     Was wont to steal the hermit's hymn

     Devotion borrows Music's tone,
     And Music took Devotion's wing;
     And, like the bird that hails the sun,
     They soar to heaven, and soaring sing.
     The Hermit of St Clement's Well
</pre>
    <p>
      It was after three hours' good walking that the servants of Cedric, with
      their mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in the forest, in the
      centre of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing its
      twisted branches in every direction. Beneath this tree four or five yeomen
      lay stretched on the ground, while another, as sentinel, walked to and fro
      in the moonlight shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave the
      alarm, and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows. Six
      arrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which
      the travellers approached, when their guide, being recognised, was
      welcomed with every token of respect and attachment, and all signs and
      fears of a rough reception at once subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the Miller?&rdquo; was his first question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the road towards Rotherham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With how many?&rdquo; demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With six men, and good hope of booty, if it please St Nicholas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devoutly spoken,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;and where is Allan-a-Dale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walked up towards the Watling-street, to watch for the Prior of
      Jorvaulx.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well thought on also,&rdquo; replied the Captain;&mdash;&ldquo;and where is
      the Friar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his cell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thither will I go,&rdquo; said Locksley. &ldquo;Disperse and seek your companions.
      Collect what force you can, for there's game afoot that must be hunted
      hard, and will turn to bay. Meet me here by daybreak.&mdash;And stay,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I have forgotten what is most necessary of the whole&mdash;Two of
      you take the road quickly towards Torquilstone, the Castle of
      Front-de-Boeuf. A set of gallants, who have been masquerading in such
      guise as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither&mdash;Watch
      them closely, for even if they reach the castle before we collect our
      force, our honour is concerned to punish them, and we will find means to
      do so. Keep a close watch on them therefore; and dispatch one of your
      comrades, the lightest of foot, to bring the news of the yeomen
      thereabout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on their
      different errands. In the meanwhile, their leader and his two companions,
      who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some fear, pursued
      their way to the Chapel of Copmanhurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the
      reverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well suited to
      ascetic devotion, Wamba whispered to Gurth, &ldquo;If this be the habitation of
      a thief, it makes good the old proverb, The nearer the church the farther
      from God.&mdash;And by my coxcomb,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I think it be even so&mdash;Hearken
      but to the black sanctus which they are singing in the hermitage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent of
      their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was the
      burden:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Come, trowl the brown bowl to me,
     Bully boy, bully boy,
     Come, trowl the brown bowl to me:
     Ho! jolly Jenkin, I spy a knave in drinking,
     Come, trowl the brown bowl to me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that is not ill sung,&rdquo; said Wamba, who had thrown in a few of his
      own flourishes to help out the chorus. &ldquo;But who, in the saint's name, ever
      expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermit's cell at
      midnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, that should I,&rdquo; said Gurth, &ldquo;for the jolly Clerk of Copmanhurst is
      a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk. Men say
      that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he will be
      stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they were thus speaking, Locksley's loud and repeated knocks had at
      length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. &ldquo;By my beads,&rdquo; said the
      hermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, &ldquo;here come more benighted
      guests. I would not for my cowl that they found us in this goodly
      exercise. All men have their enemies, good Sir Sluggard; and there be
      those malignant enough to construe the hospitable refreshment which I have
      been offering to you, a weary traveller, for the matter of three short
      hours, into sheer drunkenness and debauchery, vices alike alien to my
      profession and my disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Base calumniators!&rdquo; replied the knight; &ldquo;I would I had the chastising of
      them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, it is true that all have their enemies;
      and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak to through
      the bars of my helmet than barefaced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thine iron pot on thy head then, friend Sluggard, as quickly as thy
      nature will permit,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;while I remove these pewter
      flagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate; and to drown
      the clatter&mdash;for, in faith, I feel somewhat unsteady&mdash;strike
      into the tune which thou hearest me sing; it is no matter for the words&mdash;I
      scarce know them myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he struck up a thundering &ldquo;De profundis clamavi&rdquo;, under cover
      of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet: while the knight,
      laughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted his host
      with his voice from time to time as his mirth permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What devil's matins are you after at this hour?&rdquo; said a voice from
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forgive you, Sir Traveller!&rdquo; said the hermit, whose own noise, and
      perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents which
      were tolerably familiar to him&mdash;&ldquo;Wend on your way, in the name of God
      and Saint Dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad priest,&rdquo; answered the voice from without, &ldquo;open to Locksley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All's safe&mdash;all's right,&rdquo; said the hermit to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is he?&rdquo; said the Black Knight; &ldquo;it imports me much to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; answered the hermit; &ldquo;I tell thee he is a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what friend?&rdquo; answered the knight; &ldquo;for he may be friend to thee and
      none of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What friend?&rdquo; replied the hermit; &ldquo;that, now, is one of the questions
      that is more easily asked than answered. What friend?&mdash;why, he is,
      now that I bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper I told thee of
      a while since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit,&rdquo; replied the knight,
      &ldquo;I doubt it not. But undo the door to him before he beat it from its
      hinges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the
      commencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice of him
      who stood without; for, totally changing their manner, they scratched and
      whined at the door, as if interceding for his admission. The hermit
      speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted Locksley, with his two
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hermit,&rdquo; was the yeoman's first question as soon as he beheld the
      knight, &ldquo;what boon companion hast thou here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brother of our order,&rdquo; replied the friar, shaking his head; &ldquo;we have
      been at our orisons all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a monk of the church militant, I think,&rdquo; answered Locksley; &ldquo;and
      there be more of them abroad. I tell thee, friar, thou must lay down the
      rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of our merry
      men, whether clerk or layman.&mdash;But,&rdquo; he added, taking him a step
      aside, &ldquo;art thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know?
      Hast thou forgot our articles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know him!&rdquo; replied the friar, boldly, &ldquo;I know him as well as the
      beggar knows his dish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is his name, then?&rdquo; demanded Locksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said the hermit&mdash;&ldquo;his name is Sir Anthony of Scrabelstone&mdash;as
      if I would drink with a man, and did not know his name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,&rdquo; said the woodsman,
      &ldquo;and, I fear, prating more than enough too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good yeoman,&rdquo; said the knight, coming forward, &ldquo;be not wroth with my
      merry host. He did but afford me the hospitality which I would have
      compelled from him if he had refused it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou compel!&rdquo; said the friar; &ldquo;wait but till have changed this grey gown
      for a green cassock, and if I make not a quarter-staff ring twelve upon
      thy pate, I am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close black
      buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a cassock of
      green, and hose of the same colour. &ldquo;I pray thee truss my points,&rdquo; said he
      to Wamba, &ldquo;and thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gramercy for thy sack,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;but think'st thou it is lawful for
      me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful
      forester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said the hermit; &ldquo;I will but confess the sins of my green
      cloak to my greyfriar's frock, and all shall be well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; answered the Jester; &ldquo;a broadcloth penitent should have a
      sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into the
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the
      endless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the
      doublet were then termed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were thus employed, Locksley led the knight a little apart, and
      addressed him thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Deny it not, Sir Knight&mdash;you are he who
      decided the victory to the advantage of the English against the strangers
      on the second day of the tournament at Ashby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?&rdquo; replied the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should in that case hold you,&rdquo; replied the yeoman, &ldquo;a friend to the
      weaker party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is the duty of a true knight at least,&rdquo; replied the Black Champion;
      &ldquo;and I would not willingly that there were reason to think otherwise of
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for my purpose,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;thou shouldst be as well a good
      Englishman as a good knight; for that, which I have to speak of, concerns,
      indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially that of a
      true-born native of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can speak to no one,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;to whom England, and the
      life of every Englishman, can be dearer than to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would willingly believe so,&rdquo; said the woodsman, &ldquo;for never had this
      country such need to be supported by those who love her. Hear me, and I
      will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be'st really that which
      thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. A band of villains, in
      the disguise of better men than themselves, have made themselves master of
      the person of a noble Englishman, called Cedric the Saxon, together with
      his ward, and his friend Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and have transported
      them to a castle in this forest, called Torquilstone. I ask of thee, as a
      good knight and a good Englishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bound by my vow to do so,&rdquo; replied the knight; &ldquo;but I would
      willingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their behalf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the forester, &ldquo;a nameless man; but I am the friend of my
      country, and of my country's friends&mdash;With this account of me you
      must for the present remain satisfied, the more especially since you
      yourself desire to continue unknown. Believe, however, that my word, when
      pledged, is as inviolate as if I wore golden spurs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I willingly believe it,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;I have been accustomed to
      study men's countenances, and I can read in thine honesty and resolution.
      I will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid thee in setting
      at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, I trust we shall part
      better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Wamba to Gurth,&mdash;for the friar being now fully equipped,
      the Jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the
      conclusion of the conversation,&mdash;&ldquo;So we have got a new ally?&mdash;l
      trust the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of
      the hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this Locksley looks like a
      born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold thy peace, Wamba,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;it may all be as thou dost guess;
      but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to set at
      liberty Cedric and the Lady Rowena, I fear I should hardly have religion
      enough to refuse the foul fiend's offer, and bid him get behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and
      buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. He left
      his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the door,
      deposited the key under the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou in condition to do good service, friar,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;or does
      the brown bowl still run in thy head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than a drought of St Dunstan's fountain will allay,&rdquo; answered
      the priest; &ldquo;something there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of
      instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of the
      fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white moonlight,
      and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, Holy Clerk of
      Copmanhurst?&rdquo; said the Black Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal
      vent,&rdquo; replied the friar, &ldquo;and so left me nothing to drink but my patron's
      bounty here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them
      all marks of the midnight revel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan
      round his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed,
      exclaiming at the same time, &ldquo;Where be those false ravishers, who carry
      off wenches against their will? May the foul fiend fly off with me, if I
      am not man enough for a dozen of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swearest thou, Holy Clerk?&rdquo; said the Black Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clerk me no Clerks,&rdquo; replied the transformed priest; &ldquo;by Saint George and
      the Dragon, I am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my back&mdash;When
      I am cased in my green cassock, I will drink, swear, and woo a lass, with
      any blithe forester in the West Riding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Jack Priest,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;and be silent; thou art as noisy
      as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the Father Abbot has gone to bed.&mdash;Come
      on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it&mdash;I say, come on, we
      must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have, if we are to
      storm the Castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is it Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;who has stopt on the
      king's highway the king's liege subjects?&mdash;Is he turned thief and
      oppressor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oppressor he ever was,&rdquo; said Locksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for thief,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I doubt if ever he were even half so
      honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move on, priest, and be silent,&rdquo; said the yeoman; &ldquo;it were better you led
      the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what should be left unsaid,
      both in decency and prudence.&rdquo;

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Alas, how many hours and years have past,
     Since human forms have round this table sate,
     Or lamp, or taper, on its surface gleam'd!
     Methinks, I hear the sound of time long pass'd
     Still murmuring o'er us, in the lofty void
     Of these dark arches, like the ling'ring voices
     Of those who long within their graves have slept.
     Orra, a Tragedy
</pre>
    <p>
      While these measures were taking in behalf of Cedric and his companions,
      the armed men by whom the latter had been seized, hurried their captives
      along towards the place of security, where they intended to imprison them.
      But darkness came on fast, and the paths of the wood seemed but
      imperfectly known to the marauders. They were compelled to make several
      long halts, and once or twice to return on their road to resume the
      direction which they wished to pursue. The summer morn had dawned upon
      them ere they could travel in full assurance that they held the right
      path. But confidence returned with light, and the cavalcade now moved
      rapidly forward. Meanwhile, the following dialogue took place between the
      two leaders of the banditti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time thou shouldst leave us, Sir Maurice,&rdquo; said the Templar to De
      Bracy, &ldquo;in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. Thou art next,
      thou knowest, to act the Knight Deliverer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought better of it,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I will not leave thee till
      the prize is fairly deposited in Front-de-Boeuf's castle. There will I
      appear before the Lady Rowena in mine own shape, and trust that she will
      set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which I have been
      guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has made thee change thy plan, De Bracy?&rdquo; replied the Knight
      Templar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That concerns thee nothing,&rdquo; answered his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would hope, however, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;that this
      alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable meaning,
      such as Fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My thoughts are my own,&rdquo; answered De Bracy; &ldquo;the fiend laughs, they say,
      when one thief robs another; and we know, that were he to spit fire and
      brimstone instead, it would never prevent a Templar from following his
      bent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the leader of a Free Company,&rdquo; answered the Templar, &ldquo;from dreading at
      the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice he does to all mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is unprofitable and perilous recrimination,&rdquo; answered De Bracy;
      &ldquo;suffice it to say, I know the morals of the Temple-Order, and I will not
      give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which I have
      run such risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha,&rdquo; replied the Templar, &ldquo;what hast thou to fear?&mdash;Thou knowest
      the vows of our order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right well,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;and also how they are kept. Come, Sir
      Templar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in Palestine,
      and this is a case in which I will trust nothing to your conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear the truth, then,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;I care not for your blue-eyed
      beauty. There is in that train one who will make me a better mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel?&rdquo; said De Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Templar, haughtily. &ldquo;To the waiting-woman will
      I not stoop. I have a prize among the captives as lovely as thine own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the mass, thou meanest the fair Jewess!&rdquo; said De Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I do,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;who shall gainsay me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one that I know,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;unless it be your vow of celibacy,
      or a check of conscience for an intrigue with a Jewess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my vow,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;our Grand Master hath granted me a
      dispensation. And for my conscience, a man that has slain three hundred
      Saracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl at
      her first confession upon Good Friday eve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou knowest best thine own privileges,&rdquo; said De Bracy. &ldquo;Yet, I would
      have sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurer's money bags, than
      on the black eyes of the daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can admire both,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;besides, the old Jew is but
      half-prize. I must share his spoils with Front-de-Boeuf, who will not lend
      us the use of his castle for nothing. I must have something that I can
      term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and I have fixed on the
      lovely Jewess as my peculiar prize. But, now thou knowest my drift, thou
      wilt resume thine own original plan, wilt thou not?&mdash;Thou hast
      nothing, thou seest, to fear from my interference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;I will remain beside my prize. What thou sayst is
      passing true, but I like not the privileges acquired by the dispensation
      of the Grand Master, and the merit acquired by the slaughter of three
      hundred Saracens. You have too good a right to a free pardon, to render
      you very scrupulous about peccadilloes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this dialogue was proceeding, Cedric was endeavouring to wring out
      of those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose. &ldquo;You
      should be Englishmen,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and yet, sacred Heaven! you prey upon
      your countrymen as if you were very Normans. You should be my neighbours,
      and, if so, my friends; for which of my English neighbours have reason to
      be otherwise? I tell ye, yeomen, that even those among ye who have been
      branded with outlawry have had from me protection; for I have pitied their
      miseries, and curst the oppression of their tyrannic nobles. What, then,
      would you have of me? or in what can this violence serve ye?&mdash;Ye are
      worse than brute beasts in your actions, and will you imitate them in
      their very dumbness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too many
      good reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either by his
      wrath or his expostulations. They continued to hurry him along, travelling
      at a very rapid rate, until, at the end of an avenue of huge trees, arose
      Torquilstone, now the hoary and ancient castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.
      It was a fortress of no great size, consisting of a donjon, or large and
      high square tower, surrounded by buildings of inferior height, which were
      encircled by an inner court-yard. Around the exterior wall was a deep
      moat, supplied with water from a neighbouring rivulet. Front-de-Boeuf,
      whose character placed him often at feud with his enemies, had made
      considerable additions to the strength of his castle, by building towers
      upon the outward wall, so as to flank it at every angle. The access, as
      usual in castles of the period, lay through an arched barbican, or
      outwork, which was terminated and defended by a small turret at each
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cedric no sooner saw the turrets of Front-de-Boeuf's castle raise their
      grey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morning sun above the
      wood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly
      concerning the cause of his misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did injustice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the thieves and outlaws of these woods,
      when I supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; I might as justly
      have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening wolves of
      France. Tell me, dogs&mdash;is it my life or my wealth that your master
      aims at? Is it too much that two Saxons, myself and the noble Athelstane,
      should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony of our race?&mdash;Put
      us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking our lives, as you
      began with our liberties. If the Saxon Cedric cannot rescue England, he is
      willing to die for her. Tell your tyrannical master, I do only beseech him
      to dismiss the Lady Rowena in honour and safety. She is a woman, and he
      need not dread her; and with us will die all who dare fight in her cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and they
      now stood before the gate of the castle. De Bracy winded his horn three
      times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall upon
      seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit them.
      The prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were conducted
      to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them, of which none but
      Athelstane felt any inclination to partake. Neither had the descendant of
      the Confessor much time to do justice to the good cheer placed before
      them, for their guards gave him and Cedric to understand that they were to
      be imprisoned in a chamber apart from Rowena. Resistance was vain; and
      they were compelled to follow to a large room, which, rising on clumsy
      Saxon pillars, resembled those refectories and chapter-houses which may be
      still seen in the most ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with
      courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to a
      distant apartment. The same alarming distinction was conferred on Rebecca,
      in spite of her father's entreaties, who offered even money, in this
      extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with him.
      &ldquo;Base unbeliever,&rdquo; answered one of his guards, &ldquo;when thou hast seen thy
      lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.&rdquo; And, without farther
      discussion, the old Jew was forcibly dragged off in a different direction
      from the other prisoners. The domestics, after being carefully searched
      and disarmed, were confined in another part of the castle; and Rowena was
      refused even the comfort she might have derived from the attendance of her
      handmaiden Elgitha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment in which the Saxon chiefs were confined, for to them we turn
      our first attention, although at present used as a sort of guard-room, had
      formerly been the great hall of the castle. It was now abandoned to meaner
      purposes, because the present lord, among other additions to the
      convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial residence, had erected a
      new and noble hall, whose vaulted roof was supported by lighter and more
      elegant pillars, and fitted up with that higher degree of ornament, which
      the Normans had already introduced into architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the past
      and on the present, while the apathy of his companion served, instead of
      patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing save the
      inconvenience of the present moment; and so little did he feel even this
      last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by Cedric's
      animated and impassioned appeal to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing himself
      to Athelstane, &ldquo;it was in this very hall that my father feasted with
      Torquil Wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate
      Harold, then advancing against the Norwegians, who had united themselves
      to the rebel Tosti. It was in this hall that Harold returned the
      magnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother. Oft have I
      heard my father kindle as he told the tale. The envoy of Tosti was
      admitted, when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd of noble
      Saxon leaders, who were quaffing the blood-red wine around their monarch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friend's
      discourse, &ldquo;they will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at
      noon&mdash;we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and
      I never have the benefit of my food when I eat immediately after
      dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional
      observation of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The envoy of Tosti,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;moved up the hall, undismayed by the
      frowning countenances of all around him, until he made his obeisance
      before the throne of King Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What terms,' he said, 'Lord King, hath thy brother Tosti to hope, if he
      should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy hands?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A brother's love,' cried the generous Harold, 'and the fair earldom of
      Northumberland.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But should Tosti accept these terms,' continued the envoy, 'what lands
      shall be assigned to his faithful ally, Hardrada, King of Norway?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Seven feet of English ground,' answered Harold, fiercely, 'or, as
      Hardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve inches
      more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to the
      Norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his English territory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have pledged him with all my soul,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;for my
      tongue cleaves to my palate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The baffled envoy,&rdquo; continued Cedric, pursuing with animation his tale,
      though it interested not the listener, &ldquo;retreated, to carry to Tosti and
      his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. It was then that the
      distant towers of York, and the bloody streams of the Derwent, <a
      href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26" id="linknoteref-26"><small>26</small></a>
      beheld that direful conflict, in which, after displaying the most
      undaunted valour, the King of Norway, and Tosti, both fell, with ten
      thousand of their bravest followers. Who would have thought that upon the
      proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which waved the Saxon
      banners in triumph, was filling the Norman sails, and impelling them to
      the fatal shores of Sussex?&mdash;Who would have thought that Harold,
      within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom,
      than the share which he allotted in his wrath to the Norwegian invader?&mdash;Who
      would have thought that you, noble Athelstane&mdash;that you, descended of
      Harold's blood, and that I, whose father was not the worst defender of the
      Saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile Norman, in the very hall in
      which our ancestors held such high festival?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sad enough,&rdquo; replied Athelstane; &ldquo;but I trust they will hold us to
      a moderate ransom&mdash;At any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve
      us outright; and yet, although it is high noon, I see no preparations for
      serving dinner. Look up at the window, noble Cedric, and judge by the
      sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; answered Cedric; &ldquo;but I cannot look on that stained
      lattice without its awakening other reflections than those which concern
      the passing moment, or its privations. When that window was wrought, my
      noble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art of making glass, or of
      staining it&mdash;The pride of Wolfganger's father brought an artist from
      Normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment, that
      breaks the golden light of God's blessed day into so many fantastic hues.
      The foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing, and subservient, ready
      to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household. He returned
      pampered and proud, to tell his rapacious countrymen of the wealth and the
      simplicity of the Saxon nobles&mdash;a folly, oh, Athelstane, foreboded of
      old, as well as foreseen, by those descendants of Hengist and his hardy
      tribes, who retained the simplicity of their manners. We made these
      strangers our bosom friends, our confidential servants; we borrowed their
      artists and their arts, and despised the honest simplicity and hardihood
      with which our brave ancestors supported themselves, and we became
      enervated by Norman arts long ere we fell under Norman arms. Far better
      was our homely diet, eaten in peace and liberty, than the luxurious
      dainties, the love of which hath delivered us as bondsmen to the foreign
      conqueror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should,&rdquo; replied Athelstane, &ldquo;hold very humble diet a luxury at
      present; and it astonishes me, noble Cedric, that you can bear so truly in
      mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very hour
      of dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time lost,&rdquo; muttered Cedric apart and impatiently, &ldquo;to speak to him
      of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! The soul of
      Hardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save to
      fill, to swill, and to call for more.&mdash;Alas!&rdquo; said he, looking at
      Athelstane with compassion, &ldquo;that so dull a spirit should be lodged in so
      goodly a form! Alas! that such an enterprise as the regeneration of
      England should turn on a hinge so imperfect! Wedded to Rowena, indeed, her
      nobler and more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which is
      torpid within him. Yet how should this be, while Rowena, Athelstane, and I
      myself, remain the prisoners of this brutal marauder and have been made so
      perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty might bring to the
      usurped power of his nation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the Saxon was plunged in these painful reflections, the door of
      their prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding his white rod
      of office. This important person advanced into the chamber with a grave
      pace, followed by four attendants, bearing in a table covered with dishes,
      the sight and smell of which seemed to be an instant compensation to
      Athelstane for all the inconvenience he had undergone. The persons who
      attended on the feast were masked and cloaked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mummery is this?&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;think you that we are ignorant whose
      prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of your master? Tell him,&rdquo; he
      continued, willing to use this opportunity to open a negotiation for his
      freedom,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell your master, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, that we know no
      reason he can have for withholding our liberty, excepting his unlawful
      desire to enrich himself at our expense. Tell him that we yield to his
      rapacity, as in similar circumstances we should do to that of a literal
      robber. Let him name the ransom at which he rates our liberty, and it
      shall be paid, providing the exaction is suited to our means.&rdquo; The sewer
      made no answer, but bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;that I send him
      my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me, on foot or
      horseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation;
      which, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these circumstances,
      venture to refuse or to delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall deliver to the knight your defiance,&rdquo; answered the sewer;
      &ldquo;meanwhile I leave you to your food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The challenge of Athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a large
      mouthful, which required the exercise of both jaws at once, added to a
      natural hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold defiance it
      contained. Still, however, his speech was hailed by Cedric as an
      incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion, whose previous
      indifference had begun, notwithstanding his respect for Athelstane's
      descent, to wear out his patience. But he now cordially shook hands with
      him in token of his approbation, and was somewhat grieved when Athelstane
      observed, &ldquo;that he would fight a dozen such men as Front-de-Boeuf, if, by
      so doing, he could hasten his departure from a dungeon where they put so
      much garlic into their pottage.&rdquo; Notwithstanding this intimation of a
      relapse into the apathy of sensuality, Cedric placed himself opposite to
      Athelstane, and soon showed, that if the distresses of his country could
      banish the recollection of food while the table was uncovered, yet no
      sooner were the victuals put there, than he proved that the appetite of
      his Saxon ancestors had descended to him along with their other qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment, however, ere their
      attention was disturbed even from this most serious occupation by the
      blast of a horn winded before the gate. It was repeated three times, with
      as much violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted castle by the
      destined knight, at whose summons halls and towers, barbican and
      battlement, were to roll off like a morning vapour. The Saxons started
      from the table, and hastened to the window. But their curiosity was
      disappointed; for these outlets only looked upon the court of the castle,
      and the sound came from beyond its precincts. The summons, however, seemed
      of importance, for a considerable degree of bustle instantly took place in
      the castle.

    <p>
      Leaving the Saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their
      ungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of their
      half-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more severe
      imprisonment of Isaac of York. The poor Jew had been hastily thrust into a
      dungeon-vault of the castle, the floor of which was deep beneath the level
      of the ground, and very damp, being lower than even the moat itself. The
      only light was received through one or two loop-holes far above the reach
      of the captive's hand. These apertures admitted, even at mid-day, only a
      dim and uncertain light, which was changed for utter darkness long before
      the rest of the castle had lost the blessing of day. Chains and shackles,
      which had been the portion of former captives, from whom active exertions
      to escape had been apprehended, hung rusted and empty on the walls of the
      prison, and in the rings of one of those sets of fetters there remained
      two mouldering bones, which seemed to have been once those of the human
      leg, as if some prisoner had been left not only to perish there, but to be
      consumed to a skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one end of this ghastly apartment was a large fire-grate, over the top
      of which were stretched some transverse iron bars, half devoured with
      rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart
      than that of Isaac, who, nevertheless, was more composed under the
      imminent pressure of danger, than he had seemed to be while affected by
      terrors, of which the cause was as yet remote and contingent. The lovers
      of the chase say that the hare feels more agony during the pursuit of the
      greyhounds, than when she is struggling in their fangs. <a
      href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27"><small>27</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it is probable, that the Jews, by the very frequency of their
      fear on all occasions, had their minds in some degree prepared for every
      effort of tyranny which could be practised upon them; so that no
      aggression, when it had taken place, could bring with it that surprise
      which is the most disabling quality of terror. Neither was it the first
      time that Isaac had been placed in circumstances so dangerous. He had
      therefore experience to guide him, as well as hope, that he might again,
      as formerly, be delivered as a prey from the fowler. Above all, he had
      upon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation, and that unbending
      resolution, with which Israelites have been frequently known to submit to
      the uttermost evils which power and violence can inflict upon them, rather
      than gratify their oppressors by granting their demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this humour of passive resistance, and with his garment collected
      beneath him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement, Isaac sat in a corner
      of his dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and beard,
      his furred cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry and broken light, would
      have afforded a study for Rembrandt, had that celebrated painter existed
      at the period. The Jew remained, without altering his position, for nearly
      three hours, at the expiry of which steps were heard on the dungeon stair.
      The bolts screamed as they were withdrawn&mdash;the hinges creaked as the
      wicket opened, and Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, followed by the two Saracen
      slaves of the Templar, entered the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Front-de-Boeuf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in public
      war or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitated at no means of
      extending his feudal power, had features corresponding to his character,
      and which strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant passions of
      the mind. The scars with which his visage was seamed, would, on features
      of a different cast, have excited the sympathy and veneration due to the
      marks of honourable valour; but, in the peculiar case of Front-de-Boeuf,
      they only added to the ferocity of his countenance, and to the dread which
      his presence inspired. This formidable baron was clad in a leathern
      doublet, fitted close to his body, which was frayed and soiled with the
      stains of his armour. He had no weapon, excepting a poniard at his belt,
      which served to counterbalance the weight of the bunch of rusty keys that
      hung at his right side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black slaves who attended Front-de-Boeuf were stripped of their
      gorgeous apparel, and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarse linen,
      their sleeves being tucked up above the elbow, like those of butchers when
      about to exercise their function in the slaughter-house. Each had in his
      hand a small pannier; and, when they entered the dungeon, they stopt at
      the door until Front-de-Boeuf himself carefully locked and double-locked
      it. Having taken this precaution, he advanced slowly up the apartment
      towards the Jew, upon whom he kept his eye fixed, as if he wished to
      paralyze him with his glance, as some animals are said to fascinate their
      prey. It seemed indeed as if the sullen and malignant eye of
      Front-de-Boeuf possessed some portion of that supposed power over his
      unfortunate prisoner. The Jew sat with his mouth agape, and his eyes fixed
      on the savage baron with such earnestness of terror, that his frame seemed
      literally to shrink together, and to diminish in size while encountering
      the fierce Norman's fixed and baleful gaze. The unhappy Isaac was deprived
      not only of the power of rising to make the obeisance which his terror
      dictated, but he could not even doff his cap, or utter any word of
      supplication; so strongly was he agitated by the conviction that tortures
      and death were impending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the stately form of the Norman appeared to dilate in
      magnitude, like that of the eagle, which ruffles up its plumage when about
      to pounce on its defenceless prey. He paused within three steps of the
      corner in which the unfortunate Jew had now, as it were, coiled himself up
      into the smallest possible space, and made a sign for one of the slaves to
      approach. The black satellite came forward accordingly, and, producing
      from his basket a large pair of scales and several weights, he laid them
      at the feet of Front-de-Boeuf, and again retired to the respectful
      distance, at which his companion had already taken his station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motions of these men were slow and solemn, as if there impended over
      their souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty. Front-de-Boeuf
      himself opened the scene by thus addressing his ill-fated captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most accursed dog of an accursed race,&rdquo; he said, awaking with his deep
      and sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault, &ldquo;seest thou these
      scales?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy Jew returned a feeble affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In these very scales shalt thou weigh me out,&rdquo; said the relentless Baron,
      &ldquo;a thousand silver pounds, after the just measure and weight of the Tower
      of London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Abraham!&rdquo; returned the Jew, finding voice through the very extremity
      of his danger, &ldquo;heard man ever such a demand?&mdash;Who ever heard, even
      in a minstrel's tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds of silver?&mdash;What
      human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such a mass of treasure?&mdash;Not
      within the walls of York, ransack my house and that of all my tribe, wilt
      thou find the tithe of that huge sum of silver that thou speakest of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am reasonable,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;and if silver be scant, I
      refuse not gold. At the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of
      silver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as
      thy heart has never even conceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have mercy on me, noble knight!&rdquo; exclaimed Isaac; &ldquo;I am old, and poor,
      and helpless. It were unworthy to triumph over me&mdash;It is a poor deed
      to crush a worm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old thou mayst be,&rdquo; replied the knight; &ldquo;more shame to their folly who
      have suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery&mdash;Feeble thou
      mayst be, for when had a Jew either heart or hand&mdash;But rich it is
      well known thou art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, noble knight,&rdquo; said the Jew &ldquo;by all which I believe, and
      by all which we believe in common&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perjure not thyself,&rdquo; said the Norman, interrupting him, &ldquo;and let not
      thine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and well considered
      the fate that awaits thee. Think not I speak to thee only to excite thy
      terror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy
      tribe. I swear to thee by that which thou dost NOT believe, by the gospel
      which our church teaches, and by the keys which are given her to bind and
      to loose, that my purpose is deep and peremptory. This dungeon is no place
      for trifling. Prisoners ten thousand times more distinguished than thou
      have died within these walls, and their fate hath never been known! But
      for thee is reserved a long and lingering death, to which theirs were
      luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them
      apart, in their own language; for he also had been in Palestine, where
      perhaps, he had learnt his lesson of cruelty. The Saracens produced from
      their baskets a quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows, and a flask of
      oil. While the one struck a light with a flint and steel, the other
      disposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which we have already
      mentioned, and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a red glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seest thou, Isaac,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;the range of iron bars above
      the glowing charcoal?&mdash; <a href="#linknote-28" name="linknoteref-28"       id="linknoteref-28"><small>28</small></a> on that warm couch thou shalt
      lie, stripped of thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down. One
      of these slaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee, while the other
      shall anoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should burn.&mdash;Now,
      choose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a thousand pounds
      of silver; for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other option.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; exclaimed the miserable Jew&mdash;&ldquo;it is impossible
      that your purpose can be real! The good God of nature never made a heart
      capable of exercising such cruelty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust not to that, Isaac,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;it were a fatal error.
      Dost thou think that I, who have seen a town sacked, in which thousands of
      my Christian countrymen perished by sword, by flood, and by fire, will
      blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single wretched
      Jew?&mdash;or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have neither
      law, country, nor conscience, but their master's will&mdash;who use the
      poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest wink&mdash;thinkest
      thou that THEY will have mercy, who do not even understand the language in
      which it is asked?&mdash;Be wise, old man; discharge thyself of a portion
      of thy superfluous wealth; repay to the hands of a Christian a part of
      what thou hast acquired by the usury thou hast practised on those of his
      religion. Thy cunning may soon swell out once more thy shrivelled purse,
      but neither leech nor medicine can restore thy scorched hide and flesh
      wert thou once stretched on these bars. Tell down thy ransom, I say, and
      rejoice that at such rate thou canst redeem thee from a dungeon, the
      secrets of which few have returned to tell. I waste no more words with
      thee&mdash;choose between thy dross and thy flesh and blood, and as thou
      choosest, so shall it be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So may Abraham, Jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist me,&rdquo; said
      Isaac, &ldquo;I cannot make the choice, because I have not the means of
      satisfying your exorbitant demand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize him and strip him, slaves,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;and let the fathers
      of his race assist him if they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistants, taking their directions more from the Baron's eye and his
      hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laid hands on the
      unfortunate Isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him
      between them, waited the hard-hearted Baron's farther signal. The unhappy
      Jew eyed their countenances and that of Front-de-Boeuf, in hope of
      discovering some symptoms of relenting; but that of the Baron exhibited
      the same cold, half-sullen, half-sarcastic smile which had been the
      prelude to his cruelty; and the savage eyes of the Saracens, rolling
      gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet more sinister expression
      by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the pupil, evinced rather
      the secret pleasure which they expected from the approaching scene, than
      any reluctance to be its directors or agents. The Jew then looked at the
      glowing furnace, over which he was presently to be stretched, and seeing
      no chance of his tormentor's relenting, his resolution gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will pay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the thousand pounds of silver&mdash;That is,&rdquo; he
      added, after a moment's pause, &ldquo;I will pay it with the help of my
      brethren; for I must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue ere I
      make up so unheard-of a sum.&mdash;When and where must it be delivered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;here it must be delivered&mdash;weighed
      it must be&mdash;weighed and told down on this very dungeon floor.&mdash;Thinkest
      thou I will part with thee until thy ransom is secure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is to be my surety,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that I shall be at liberty
      after this ransom is paid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word of a Norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave,&rdquo; answered
      Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;the faith of a Norman nobleman, more pure than the gold
      and silver of thee and all thy tribe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave pardon, noble lord,&rdquo; said Isaac timidly, &ldquo;but wherefore should I
      rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because thou canst not help it, Jew,&rdquo; said the knight, sternly. &ldquo;Wert
      thou now in thy treasure-chamber at York, and were I craving a loan of thy
      shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the pledge
      of security. This is MY treasure-chamber. Here I have thee at advantage,
      nor will I again deign to repeat the terms on which I grant thee liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jew groaned deeply.&mdash;&ldquo;Grant me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at least with my own
      liberty, that of the companions with whom I travel. They scorned me as a
      Jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid me by
      the way, a share of my evil hath come upon them; moreover, they may
      contribute in some sort to my ransom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou meanest yonder Saxon churls,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;their ransom
      will depend upon other terms than thine. Mind thine own concerns, Jew, I
      warn thee, and meddle not with those of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, then,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;only to be set at liberty, together with mine
      wounded friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I twice recommend it,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;to a son of Israel, to
      meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of others alone?&mdash;Since
      thou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest down thy
      ransom, and that at a short day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet hear me,&rdquo; said the Jew&mdash;&ldquo;for the sake of that very wealth which
      thou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy&mdash;-&rdquo; Here he stopt short,
      afraid of irritating the savage Norman. But Front-de-Boeuf only laughed,
      and himself filled up the blank at which the Jew had hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, Isaac; speak it out&mdash;I
      tell thee, I am reasonable. I can bear the reproaches of a loser, even
      when that loser is a Jew. Thou wert not so patient, Isaac, when thou didst
      invoke justice against Jacques Fitzdotterel, for calling thee a usurious
      blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear by the Talmud,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;that your valour has been misled
      in that matter. Fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine own chamber,
      because I craved him for mine own silver. The term of payment was due at
      the Passover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not what he did,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;the question is, when
      shall I have mine own?&mdash;when shall I have the shekels, Isaac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let my daughter Rebecca go forth to York,&rdquo; answered Isaac, &ldquo;with your
      safe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can return, the
      treasure&mdash;-&rdquo; Here he groaned deeply, but added, after the pause of a
      few seconds,&mdash;&ldquo;The treasure shall be told down on this very floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy daughter!&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, as if surprised,&mdash;&ldquo;By heavens,
      Isaac, I would I had known of this. I deemed that yonder black-browed girl
      had been thy concubine, and I gave her to be a handmaiden to Sir Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of the days of
      old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yell which Isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the very
      vault to ring, and astounded the two Saracens so much that they let go
      their hold of the Jew. He availed himself of his enlargement to throw
      himself on the pavement, and clasp the knees of Front-de-Boeuf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take all that you have asked,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Sir Knight&mdash;take ten times
      more&mdash;reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if thou wilt,&mdash;nay,
      pierce me with thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but spare my
      daughter, deliver her in safety and honour!&mdash;As thou art born of
      woman, spare the honour of a helpless maiden&mdash;She is the image of my
      deceased Rachel, she is the last of six pledges of her love&mdash;Will you
      deprive a widowed husband of his sole remaining comfort?&mdash;Will you
      reduce a father to wish that his only living child were laid beside her
      dead mother, in the tomb of our fathers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the Norman, somewhat relenting, &ldquo;that I had known of this
      before. I thought your race had loved nothing save their moneybags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not so vilely of us, Jews though we be,&rdquo; said Isaac, eager to
      improve the moment of apparent sympathy; &ldquo;the hunted fox, the tortured
      wildcat loves its young&mdash;the despised and persecuted race of Abraham
      love their children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;I will believe it in future, Isaac, for
      thy very sake&mdash;but it aids us not now, I cannot help what has
      happened, or what is to follow; my word is passed to my comrade in arms,
      nor would I break it for ten Jews and Jewesses to boot. Besides, why
      shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became
      Bois-Guilbert's booty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will, there must!&rdquo; exclaimed Isaac, wringing his hands in agony;
      &ldquo;when did Templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, and dishonour to
      women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog of an infidel,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, with sparkling eyes, and not
      sorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion,
      &ldquo;blaspheme not the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, but take thought
      instead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, or woe betide thy Jewish
      throat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robber and villain!&rdquo; said the Jew, retorting the insults of his oppressor
      with passion, which, however impotent, he now found it impossible to
      bridle, &ldquo;I will pay thee nothing&mdash;not one silver penny will I pay
      thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou in thy senses, Israelite?&rdquo; said the Norman, sternly&mdash;&ldquo;has
      thy flesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scalding oil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not!&rdquo; said the Jew, rendered desperate by paternal affection; &ldquo;do
      thy worst. My daughter is my flesh and blood, dearer to me a thousand
      times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. No silver will I give
      thee, unless I were to pour it molten down thy avaricious throat&mdash;no,
      not a silver penny will I give thee, Nazarene, were it to save thee from
      the deep damnation thy whole life has merited! Take my life if thou wilt,
      and say, the Jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to disappoint the
      Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see that,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;for by the blessed rood, which
      is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel the extremities
      of fire and steel!&mdash;Strip him, slaves, and chain him down upon the
      bars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the Saracens had already
      torn from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to disrobe
      him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle,
      penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, and immediately after loud
      voices were heard calling for Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf. Unwilling to be
      found engaged in his hellish occupation, the savage Baron gave the slaves
      a signal to restore Isaac's garment, and, quitting the dungeon with his
      attendants, he left the Jew to thank God for his own deliverance, or to
      lament over his daughter's captivity, and probable fate, as his personal
      or parental feelings might prove strongest.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
     Can no way change you to a milder form,
     I'll woo you, like a soldier, at arms' end,
     And love you 'gainst the nature of love, force you.
     &mdash;Two Gentlemen of Verona
</pre>
    <p>
      The apartment to which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was fitted up
      with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being placed
      there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not offered to the
      other prisoners. But the wife of Front-de-Boeuf, for whom it had been
      originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect had impaired
      the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it. The tapestry hung
      down from the walls in many places, and in others was tarnished and faded
      under the effects of the sun, or tattered and decayed by age. Desolate,
      however, as it was, this was the apartment of the castle which had been
      judged most fitting for the accommodation of the Saxon heiress; and here
      she was left to meditate upon her fate, until the actors in this nefarious
      drama had arranged the several parts which each of them was to perform.
      This had been settled in a council held by Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and
      the Templar, in which, after a long and warm debate concerning the several
      advantages which each insisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in
      this audacious enterprise, they had at length determined the fate of their
      unhappy prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about the hour of noon, therefore, when De Bracy, for whose
      advantage the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute his
      views upon the hand and possessions of the Lady Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his
      confederates, for De Bracy had found leisure to decorate his person with
      all the foppery of the times. His green cassock and vizard were now flung
      aside. His long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint tresses down
      his richly furred cloak. His beard was closely shaved, his doublet reached
      to the middle of his leg, and the girdle which secured it, and at the same
      time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered and embossed with gold
      work. We have already noticed the extravagant fashion of the shoes at this
      period, and the points of Maurice de Bracy's might have challenged the
      prize of extravagance with the gayest, being turned up and twisted like
      the horns of a ram. Such was the dress of a gallant of the period; and, in
      the present instance, that effect was aided by the handsome person and
      good demeanour of the wearer, whose manners partook alike of the grace of
      a courtier, and the frankness of a soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saluted Rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden
      broach, representing St Michael trampling down the Prince of Evil. With
      this, he gently motioned the lady to a seat; and, as she still retained
      her standing posture, the knight ungloved his right hand, and motioned to
      conduct her thither. But Rowena declined, by her gesture, the proffered
      compliment, and replied, &ldquo;If I be in the presence of my jailor, Sir Knight&mdash;nor
      will circumstances allow me to think otherwise&mdash;it best becomes his
      prisoner to remain standing till she learns her doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! fair Rowena,&rdquo; returned De Bracy, &ldquo;you are in presence of your
      captive, not your jailor; and it is from your fair eyes that De Bracy must
      receive that doom which you fondly expect from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you not, sir,&rdquo; said the lady, drawing herself up with all the
      pride of offended rank and beauty; &ldquo;I know you not&mdash;and the insolent
      familiarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour, forms
      no apology for the violence of a robber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To thyself, fair maid,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, in his former tone&mdash;&ldquo;to
      thine own charms be ascribed whate'er I have done which passed the respect
      due to her, whom I have chosen queen of my heart, and lodestar of my
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat to you, Sir Knight, that I know you not, and that no man wearing
      chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence of an
      unprotected lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am unknown to you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;is indeed my misfortune; yet
      let me hope that De Bracy's name has not been always unspoken, when
      minstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in the lists
      or in the battle-field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied
      Rowena, &ldquo;more suiting for their mouths than for thine own; and tell me
      which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the memorable
      conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man, followed by a
      few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden, transported against
      her will to the castle of a robber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unjust, Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said the knight, biting his lips in some
      confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of
      affected gallantry, which he had at first adopted; &ldquo;yourself free from
      passion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although
      caused by your own beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;to cease a language so commonly
      used by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of knights or
      nobles. Certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon such
      commonplace terms, of which each vile crowder hath a stock that might last
      from hence to Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud damsel,&rdquo; said De Bracy, incensed at finding his gallant style
      procured him nothing but contempt&mdash;&ldquo;proud damsel, thou shalt be as
      proudly encountered. Know then, that I have supported my pretensions to
      your hand in the way that best suited thy character. It is meeter for thy
      humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in courtly
      language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courtesy of tongue,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;when it is used to veil churlishness
      of deed, is but a knight's girdle around the breast of a base clown. I
      wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you&mdash;more it were for
      your honour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw, than to
      veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and
      demeanour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You counsel well, lady,&rdquo; said the Norman; &ldquo;and in the bold language which
      best justifies bold action I tell thee, thou shalt never leave this
      castle, or thou shalt leave it as Maurice de Bracy's wife. I am not wont
      to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a Norman noble scrupulously to
      vindicate his conduct to the Saxon maiden whom he distinguishes by the
      offer of his hand. Thou art proud, Rowena, and thou art the fitter to be
      my wife. By what other means couldst thou be raised to high honour and to
      princely place, saving by my alliance? How else wouldst thou escape from
      the mean precincts of a country grange, where Saxons herd with the swine
      which form their wealth, to take thy seat, honoured as thou shouldst be,
      and shalt be, amid all in England that is distinguished by beauty, or
      dignified by power?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied Rowena, &ldquo;the grange which you contemn hath been my
      shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when I leave it&mdash;should that day
      ever arrive&mdash;it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the
      dwelling and manners in which I have been brought up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess your meaning, lady,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;though you may think it lies
      too obscure for my apprehension. But dream not, that Richard Coeur de Lion
      will ever resume his throne, far less that Wilfred of Ivanhoe, his minion,
      will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed as the bride of
      a favourite. Another suitor might feel jealousy while he touched this
      string; but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion so childish and
      so hopeless. Know, lady, that this rival is in my power, and that it rests
      but with me to betray the secret of his being within the castle to
      Front-de-Boeuf, whose jealousy will be more fatal than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilfred here?&rdquo; said Rowena, in disdain; &ldquo;that is as true as that
      Front-de-Boeuf is his rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wert thou really ignorant of this?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;didst thou not know that
      Wilfred of Ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the Jew?&mdash;a meet
      conveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the Holy
      Sepulchre!&rdquo; And he laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he is here,&rdquo; said Rowena, compelling herself to a tone of
      indifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she
      could not suppress, &ldquo;in what is he the rival of Front-de-Boeuf? or what
      has he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom,
      according to the use of chivalry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rowena,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;art thou, too, deceived by the common error of
      thy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting their own
      charms? Knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of wealth, as
      well as of love; and that this our host, Front-de-Boeuf, will push from
      his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of Ivanhoe, as
      readily, eagerly, and unscrupulously, as if he were preferred to him by
      some blue-eyed damsel? But smile on my suit, lady, and the wounded
      champion shall have nothing to fear from Front-de-Boeuf, whom else thou
      mayst mourn for, as in the hands of one who has never shown compassion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save him, for the love of Heaven!&rdquo; said Rowena, her firmness giving way
      under terror for her lover's impending fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&mdash;I will&mdash;it is my purpose,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;for, when
      Rowena consents to be the bride of De Bracy, who is it shall dare to put
      forth a violent hand upon her kinsman&mdash;the son of her guardian&mdash;the
      companion of her youth? But it is thy love must buy his protection. I am
      not romantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the fate, of one
      who is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my wishes. Use
      thine influence with me in his behalf, and he is safe,&mdash;refuse to
      employ it, Wilfred dies, and thou thyself art not the nearer to freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy language,&rdquo; answered Rowena, &ldquo;hath in its indifferent bluntness
      something which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to express.
      I believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flatter thyself, then, with that belief,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;until time
      shall prove it false. Thy lover lies wounded in this castle&mdash;thy
      preferred lover. He is a bar betwixt Front-de-Boeuf and that which
      Front-de-Boeuf loves better than either ambition or beauty. What will it
      cost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to silence
      his opposition for ever? Nay, were Front-de-Boeuf afraid to justify a deed
      so open, let the leech but give his patient a wrong draught&mdash;let the
      chamberlain, or the nurse who tends him, but pluck the pillow from his
      head, and Wilfred in his present condition, is sped without the effusion
      of blood. Cedric also&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Cedric also,&rdquo; said Rowena, repeating his words; &ldquo;my noble&mdash;my
      generous guardian! I deserved the evil I have encountered, for forgetting
      his fate even in that of his son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cedric's fate also depends upon thy determination,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;and I
      leave thee to form it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, Rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with
      undismayed courage, but it was because she had not considered the danger
      as serious and imminent. Her disposition was naturally that which
      physiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions, mild, timid, and
      gentle; but it had been tempered, and, as it were, hardened, by the
      circumstances of her education. Accustomed to see the will of all, even of
      Cedric himself, (sufficiently arbitrary with others,) give way before her
      wishes, she had acquired that sort of courage and self-confidence which
      arises from the habitual and constant deference of the circle in which we
      move. She could scarce conceive the possibility of her will being opposed,
      far less that of its being treated with total disregard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a fictitious
      character, induced over that which was natural to her, and it deserted her
      when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well as that
      of her lover and her guardian; and when she found her will, the slightest
      expression of which was wont to command respect and attention, now placed
      in opposition to that of a man of a strong, fierce, and determined mind,
      who possessed the advantage over her, and was resolved to use it, she
      quailed before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was nowhere
      to be found, and after a few broken interjections, she raised her hands to
      heaven, and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation and sorrow. It
      was impossible to see so beautiful a creature in such extremity without
      feeling for her, and De Bracy was not unmoved, though he was yet more
      embarrassed than touched. He had, in truth, gone too far to recede; and
      yet, in Rowena's present condition, she could not be acted on either by
      argument or threats. He paced the apartment to and fro, now vainly
      exhorting the terrified maiden to compose herself, now hesitating
      concerning his own line of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, thought he, I should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this
      disconsolate damsel, what should I reap but the loss of these fair hopes
      for which I have encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of Prince John
      and his jovial comrades? &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I feel myself ill
      framed for the part which I am playing. I cannot look on so fair a face
      while it is disturbed with agony, or on those eyes when they are drowned
      in tears. I would she had retained her original haughtiness of
      disposition, or that I had a larger share of Front-de-Boeuf's
      thrice-tempered hardness of heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate Rowena be
      comforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the excess of
      despair to which she was now giving way. But in this task of consolation
      De Bracy was interrupted by the horn, &ldquo;hoarse-winded blowing far and
      keen,&rdquo; which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates of the castle,
      and interrupted their several plans of avarice and of license. Of them
      all, perhaps, De Bracy least regretted the interruption; for his
      conference with the Lady Rowena had arrived at a point, where he found it
      equally difficult to prosecute or to resign his enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof than
      the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy representation
      of manners which has been just laid before the reader. It is grievous to
      think that those valiant barons, to whose stand against the crown the
      liberties of England were indebted for their existence, should themselves
      have been such dreadful oppressors, and capable of excesses contrary not
      only to the laws of England, but to those of nature and humanity. But,
      alas! we have only to extract from the industrious Henry one of those
      numerous passages which he has collected from contemporary historians, to
      prove that fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors
      of the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the
      cruelties exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the great barons and
      lords of castles, who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of the
      excesses of which they were capable when their passions were inflamed.
      &ldquo;They grievously oppressed the poor people by building castles; and when
      they were built, they filled them with wicked men, or rather devils, who
      seized both men and women who they imagined had any money, threw them into
      prison, and put them to more cruel tortures than the martyrs ever endured.
      They suffocated some in mud, and suspended others by the feet, or the
      head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below them. They squeezed the heads of
      some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains, while they threw
      others into dungeons swarming with serpents, snakes, and toads.&rdquo; But it
      would be cruel to put the reader to the pain of perusing the remainder of
      this description. <a href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29"       id="linknoteref-29"><small>29</small></a>

    <p>
      As another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the
      strongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that the Princess Matilda,
      though a daughter of the King of Scotland, and afterwards both Queen of
      England, niece to Edgar Atheling, and mother to the Empress of Germany,
      the daughter, the wife, and the mother of monarchs, was obliged, during
      her early residence for education in England, to assume the veil of a nun,
      as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the Norman nobles.
      This excuse she stated before a great council of the clergy of England, as
      the sole reason for her having taken the religious habit. The assembled
      clergy admitted the validity of the plea, and the notoriety of the
      circumstances upon which it was founded; giving thus an indubitable and
      most remarkable testimony to the existence of that disgraceful license by
      which that age was stained. It was a matter of public knowledge, they
      said, that after the conquest of King William, his Norman followers,
      elated by so great a victory, acknowledged no law but their own wicked
      pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered Saxons of their lands and
      their goods, but invaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters
      with the most unbridled license; and hence it was then common for matrons
      and maidens of noble families to assume the veil, and take shelter in
      convents, not as called thither by the vocation of God, but solely to
      preserve their honour from the unbridled wickedness of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public
      declaration of the assembled clergy, recorded by Eadmer; and we need add
      nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have
      detailed, and are about to detail, upon the more apocryphal authority of
      the Wardour MS.

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I'll woo her as the lion woos his bride.
     &mdash;Douglas
</pre>
    <p>
      While the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the
      castle, the Jewess Rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered
      turret. Hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and on
      being thrust into the little cell, she found herself in the presence of an
      old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a Saxon rhyme, as if to beat time
      to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon the floor.
      The hag raised her head as Rebecca entered, and scowled at the fair Jewess
      with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness, when united with
      evil conditions, are apt to look upon youth and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must up and away, old house-cricket,&rdquo; said one of the men; &ldquo;our
      noble master commands it&mdash;Thou must e'en leave this chamber to a
      fairer guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; grumbled the hag, &ldquo;even thus is service requited. I have known when
      my bare word would have cast the best man-at-arms among ye out of saddle
      and out of service; and now must I up and away at the command of every
      groom such as thou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Dame Urfried,&rdquo; said the other man, &ldquo;stand not to reason on it, but
      up and away. Lords' hests must be listened to with a quick ear. Thou hast
      had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. Thou art now the
      very emblem of an old war-horse turned out on the barren heath&mdash;thou
      hast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is the best of them&mdash;Come,
      amble off with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill omens dog ye both!&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;and a kennel be your
      burying-place! May the evil demon Zernebock tear me limb from limb, if I
      leave my own cell ere I have spun out the hemp on my distaff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer it to our lord, then, old housefiend,&rdquo; said the man, and retired;
      leaving Rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose presence she had
      been thus unwillingly forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What devil's deed have they now in the wind?&rdquo; said the old hag, murmuring
      to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and malignant glance
      at Rebecca; &ldquo;but it is easy to guess&mdash;Bright eyes, black locks, and a
      skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his black unguent&mdash;Ay,
      it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone turret, whence a shriek
      could no more be heard than at the depth of five hundred fathoms beneath
      the earth.&mdash;Thou wilt have owls for thy neighbours, fair one; and
      their screams will be heard as far, and as much regarded, as thine own.
      Outlandish, too,&rdquo; she said, marking the dress and turban of Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;What
      country art thou of?&mdash;a Saracen? or an Egyptian?&mdash;Why dost not
      answer?&mdash;thou canst weep, canst thou not speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not angry, good mother,&rdquo; said Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou needst say no more,&rdquo; replied Urfried &ldquo;men know a fox by the train,
      and a Jewess by her tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of mercy,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;tell me what I am to expect as the
      conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither! Is it my life
      they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down cheerfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy life, minion?&rdquo; answered the sibyl; &ldquo;what would taking thy life
      pleasure them?&mdash;Trust me, thy life is in no peril. Such usage shalt
      thou have as was once thought good enough for a noble Saxon maiden. And
      shall a Jewess, like thee, repine because she hath no better? Look at me&mdash;I
      was as young and twice as fair as thou, when Front-de-Boeuf, father of
      this Reginald, and his Normans, stormed this castle. My father and his
      seven sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from chamber to
      chamber&mdash;There was not a room, not a step of the stair, that was not
      slippery with their blood. They died&mdash;they died every man; and ere
      their bodies were cold, and ere their blood was dried, I had become the
      prey and the scorn of the conqueror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no help?&mdash;Are there no means of escape?&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;Richly,
      richly would I requite thine aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of it,&rdquo; said the hag; &ldquo;from hence there is no escape but
      through the gates of death; and it is late, late,&rdquo; she added, shaking her
      grey head, &ldquo;ere these open to us&mdash;Yet it is comfort to think that we
      leave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as ourselves. Fare
      thee well, Jewess!&mdash;Jew or Gentile, thy fate would be the same; for
      thou hast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity. Fare thee
      well, I say. My thread is spun out&mdash;thy task is yet to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay! stay! for Heaven's sake!&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;stay, though it be to
      curse and to revile me&mdash;thy presence is yet some protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The presence of the mother of God were no protection,&rdquo; answered the old
      woman. &ldquo;There she stands,&rdquo; pointing to a rude image of the Virgin Mary,
      &ldquo;see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of
      sneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their habitual
      frown. She locked the door behind her, and Rebecca might hear her curse
      every step for its steepness, as slowly and with difficulty she descended
      the turret-stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of Rowena;
      for what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be
      used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might be
      preserved towards a Saxon heiress? Yet had the Jewess this advantage, that
      she was better prepared by habits of thought, and by natural strength of
      mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed. Of a strong and
      observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp and wealth
      which her father displayed within his walls, or which she witnessed in the
      houses of other wealthy Hebrews, had not been able to blind her to the
      precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed. Like Damocles at
      his celebrated banquet, Rebecca perpetually beheld, amid that gorgeous
      display, the sword which was suspended over the heads of her people by a
      single hair. These reflections had tamed and brought down to a pitch of
      sounder judgment a temper, which, under other circumstances, might have
      waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her father's example and injunctions, Rebecca had learnt to bear
      herself courteously towards all who approached her. She could not indeed
      imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger to the
      meanness of mind, and to the constant state of timid apprehension, by
      which it was dictated; but she bore herself with a proud humility, as if
      submitting to the evil circumstances in which she was placed as the
      daughter of a despised race, while she felt in her mind the consciousness
      that she was entitled to hold a higher rank from her merit, than the
      arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice permitted her to aspire to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the
      firmness necessary for acting under them. Her present situation required
      all her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes
      either of escape or protection. It contained neither secret passage nor
      trap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the
      main building, seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of
      the turret. The door had no inside bolt or bar. The single window opened
      upon an embattled space surmounting the turret, which gave Rebecca, at
      first sight, some hopes of escaping; but she soon found it had no
      communication with any other part of the battlements, being an isolated
      bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a parapet, with embrasures, at
      which a few archers might be stationed for defending the turret, and
      flanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong
      reliance on Heaven natural to great and generous characters. Rebecca,
      however erroneously taught to interpret the promises of Scripture to the
      chosen people of Heaven, did not err in supposing the present to be their
      hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of Zion would be one day
      called in with the fulness of the Gentiles. In the meanwhile, all around
      her showed that their present state was that of punishment and probation,
      and that it was their especial duty to suffer without sinning. Thus
      prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune, Rebecca had
      early reflected upon her own state, and schooled her mind to meet the
      dangers which she had probably to encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was heard
      on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened, and a tall
      man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed their misfortune,
      slowly entered, and shut the door behind him; his cap, pulled down upon
      his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he held his mantle in
      such a manner as to muffle the rest. In this guise, as if prepared for the
      execution of some deed, at the thought of which he was himself ashamed, he
      stood before the affrighted prisoner; yet, ruffian as his dress bespoke
      him, he seemed at a loss to express what purpose had brought him thither,
      so that Rebecca, making an effort upon herself, had time to anticipate his
      explanation. She had already unclasped two costly bracelets and a collar,
      which she hastened to proffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally
      that to gratify his avarice was to bespeak his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take these,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;good friend, and for God's sake be merciful to me
      and my aged father! These ornaments are of value, yet are they trifling to
      what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this castle, free and
      uninjured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair flower of Palestine,&rdquo; replied the outlaw, &ldquo;these pearls are orient,
      but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds are brilliant, but
      they cannot match your eyes; and ever since I have taken up this wild
      trade, I have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not do yourself such wrong,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;take ransom, and have
      mercy!&mdash;Gold will purchase you pleasure,&mdash;to misuse us, could
      only bring thee remorse. My father will willingly satiate thy utmost
      wishes; and if thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils
      thy restoration to civil society&mdash;mayst obtain pardon for past
      errors, and be placed beyond the necessity of committing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well spoken,&rdquo; replied the outlaw in French, finding it difficult
      probably to sustain, in Saxon, a conversation which Rebecca had opened in
      that language; &ldquo;but know, bright lily of the vale of Baca! that thy father
      is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how to convert
      into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. The venerable
      Isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from him all he holds
      dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy entreaty. The ransom
      must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other coin will I accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art no outlaw,&rdquo; said Rebecca, in the same language in which he
      addressed her; &ldquo;no outlaw had refused such offers. No outlaw in this land
      uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. Thou art no outlaw, but a
      Norman&mdash;a Norman, noble perhaps in birth&mdash;O, be so in thy
      actions, and cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou, who canst guess so truly,&rdquo; said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
      dropping the mantle from his face, &ldquo;art no true daughter of Israel, but in
      all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I am not an outlaw,
      then, fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will be more prompt to hang
      thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become them,
      than to deprive thee of these ornaments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wouldst thou have of me,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;if not my wealth?&mdash;We
      can have nought in common between us&mdash;you are a Christian&mdash;I am
      a Jewess.&mdash;Our union were contrary to the laws, alike of the church
      and the synagogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were so, indeed,&rdquo; replied the Templar, laughing; &ldquo;wed with a Jewess?
      'Despardieux!'&mdash;Not if she were the Queen of Sheba! And know,
      besides, sweet daughter of Zion, that were the most Christian king to
      offer me his most Christian daughter, with Languedoc for a dowery, I could
      not wed her. It is against my vow to love any maiden, otherwise than 'par
      amours', as I will love thee. I am a Templar. Behold the cross of my Holy
      Order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darest thou appeal to it,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;on an occasion like the
      present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I do so,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;it concerns not thee, who art no
      believer in the blessed sign of our salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe as my fathers taught,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;and may God forgive my
      belief if erroneous! But you, Sir Knight, what is yours, when you appeal
      without scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you are about
      to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight, and as a man of
      religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is gravely and well preached, O daughter of Sirach!&rdquo; answered the
      Templar; &ldquo;but, gentle Ecclesiastics, thy narrow Jewish prejudices make
      thee blind to our high privilege. Marriage were an enduring crime on the
      part of a Templar; but what lesser folly I may practise, I shall speedily
      be absolved from at the next Preceptory of our Order. Not the wisest of
      monarchs, not his father, whose examples you must needs allow are weighty,
      claimed wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the Temple of Zion have
      won by our zeal in its defence. The protectors of Solomon's Temple may
      claim license by the example of Solomon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou readest the Scripture,&rdquo; said the Jewess, &ldquo;and the lives of the
      saints, only to justify thine own license and profligacy, thy crime is
      like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and necessary
      herbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the Templar flashed fire at this reproof&mdash;&ldquo;Hearken,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;Rebecca; I have hitherto spoken mildly to thee, but now my language
      shall be that of a conqueror. Thou art the captive of my bow and spear&mdash;subject
      to my will by the laws of all nations; nor will I abate an inch of my
      right, or abstain from taking by violence what thou refusest to entreaty
      or necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;stand back, and hear me ere thou
      offerest to commit a sin so deadly! My strength thou mayst indeed
      overpower for God made women weak, and trusted their defence to man's
      generosity. But I will proclaim thy villainy, Templar, from one end of
      Europe to the other. I will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what
      their compassion might refuse me, Each Preceptory&mdash;each Chapter of
      thy Order, shall learn, that, like a heretic, thou hast sinned with a
      Jewess. Those who tremble not at thy crime, will hold thee accursed for
      having so far dishonoured the cross thou wearest, as to follow a daughter
      of my people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art keen-witted, Jewess,&rdquo; replied the Templar, well aware of the
      truth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his Order condemned in the
      most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as he now
      prosecuted, and that, in some instances, even degradation had followed
      upon it&mdash;&ldquo;thou art sharp-witted,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but loud must be thy
      voice of complaint, if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this castle;
      within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams for help,
      die alike silent away. One thing only can save thee, Rebecca. Submit to
      thy fate&mdash;embrace our religion, and thou shalt go forth in such
      state, that many a Norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in beauty to
      the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the Temple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Submit to my fate!&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;and, sacred Heaven! to what fate?&mdash;embrace
      thy religion! and what religion can it be that harbours such a villain?&mdash;THOU
      the best lance of the Templars!&mdash;Craven knight!&mdash;forsworn
      priest! I spit at thee, and I defy thee.&mdash;The God of Abraham's
      promise hath opened an escape to his daughter&mdash;even from this abyss
      of infamy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she threw open the latticed window which led to the
      bartisan, and in an instant after, stood on the very verge of the parapet,
      with not the slightest screen between her and the tremendous depth below.
      Unprepared for such a desperate effort, for she had hitherto stood
      perfectly motionless, Bois-Guilbert had neither time to intercept nor to
      stop her. As he offered to advance, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Remain where thou art,
      proud Templar, or at thy choice advance!&mdash;one foot nearer, and I
      plunge myself from the precipice; my body shall be crushed out of the very
      form of humanity upon the stones of that court-yard, ere it become the
      victim of thy brutality!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards heaven,
      as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final plunge. The
      Templar hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded to pity or
      distress, gave way to his admiration of her fortitude. &ldquo;Come down,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;rash girl!&mdash;I swear by earth, and sea, and sky, I will offer
      thee no offence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not trust thee, Templar,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;thou hast taught me
      better how to estimate the virtues of thine Order. The next Preceptory
      would grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which concerned
      nought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable Jewish maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me injustice,&rdquo; exclaimed the Templar fervently; &ldquo;I swear to you by
      the name which I bear&mdash;by the cross on my bosom&mdash;by the sword on
      my side&mdash;by the ancient crest of my fathers do I swear, I will do
      thee no injury whatsoever! If not for thyself, yet for thy father's sake
      forbear! I will be his friend, and in this castle he will need a powerful
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I know it but too well&mdash;dare I trust thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured,&rdquo; said Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;if thou shalt have reason to complain of me! Many a law,
      many a commandment have I broken, but my word never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will then trust thee,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;thus far;&rdquo; and she descended from
      the verge of the battlement, but remained standing close by one of the
      embrasures, or &ldquo;machicolles&rdquo;, as they were then called.&mdash;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;I take my stand. Remain where thou art, and if thou shalt attempt
      to diminish by one step the distance now between us, thou shalt see that
      the Jewish maiden will rather trust her soul with God, than her honour to
      the Templar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Rebecca spoke thus, her high and firm resolve, which corresponded so
      well with the expressive beauty of her countenance, gave to her looks,
      air, and manner, a dignity that seemed more than mortal. Her glance
      quailed not, her cheek blanched not, for the fear of a fate so instant and
      so horrible; on the contrary, the thought that she had her fate at her
      command, and could escape at will from infamy to death, gave a yet deeper
      colour of carnation to her complexion, and a yet more brilliant fire to
      her eye. Bois-Guilbert, proud himself and high-spirited, thought he had
      never beheld beauty so animated and so commanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let there be peace between us, Rebecca,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, if thou wilt,&rdquo; answered Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;Peace&mdash;but with this
      space between.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou needst no longer fear me,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear thee not,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;thanks to him that reared this dizzy
      tower so high, that nought could fall from it and live&mdash;thanks to
      him, and to the God of Israel!&mdash;I fear thee not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou dost me injustice,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;by earth, sea, and sky, thou
      dost me injustice! I am not naturally that which you have seen me, hard,
      selfish, and relentless. It was woman that taught me cruelty, and on woman
      therefore I have exercised it; but not upon such as thou. Hear me, Rebecca&mdash;Never
      did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more devoted to the lady of
      his love than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. She, the daughter of a petty baron,
      who boasted for all his domains but a ruinous tower, and an unproductive
      vineyard, and some few leagues of the barren Landes of Bourdeaux, her name
      was known wherever deeds of arms were done, known wider than that of many
      a lady's that had a county for a dowery.&mdash;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, pacing
      up and down the little platform, with an animation in which he seemed to
      lose all consciousness of Rebecca's presence&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, my deeds, my
      danger, my blood, made the name of Adelaide de Montemare known from the
      court of Castile to that of Byzantium. And how was I requited?&mdash;When
      I returned with my dear-bought honours, purchased by toil and blood, I
      found her wedded to a Gascon squire, whose name was never heard beyond the
      limits of his own paltry domain! Truly did I love her, and bitterly did I
      revenge me of her broken faith! But my vengeance has recoiled on myself.
      Since that day I have separated myself from life and its ties&mdash;My
      manhood must know no domestic home&mdash;must be soothed by no
      affectionate wife&mdash;My age must know no kindly hearth&mdash;My grave
      must be solitary, and no offspring must outlive me, to bear the ancient
      name of Bois-Guilbert. At the feet of my Superior I have laid down the
      right of self-action&mdash;the privilege of independence. The Templar, a
      serf in all but the name, can possess neither lands nor goods, and lives,
      moves, and breathes, but at the will and pleasure of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;what advantages could compensate for such an
      absolute sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The power of vengeance, Rebecca,&rdquo; replied the Templar, &ldquo;and the prospects
      of ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An evil recompense,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;for the surrender of the rights which
      are dearest to humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say not so, maiden,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;revenge is a feast for the
      gods! And if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, to themselves, it
      is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possession of
      mere mortals.&mdash;And ambition? it is a temptation which could disturb
      even the bliss of heaven itself.&rdquo;&mdash;He paused a moment, and then
      added, &ldquo;Rebecca! she who could prefer death to dishonour, must have a
      proud and a powerful soul. Mine thou must be!&mdash;Nay, start not,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;it must be with thine own consent, and on thine own terms. Thou
      must consent to share with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from
      the throne of a monarch!&mdash;Hear me ere you answer and judge ere you
      refuse.&mdash;The Templar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his
      power of free agency, but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty body,
      before which thrones already tremble,&mdash;even as the single drop of
      rain which mixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that
      resistless ocean, which undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas. Such a
      swelling flood is that powerful league. Of this mighty Order I am no mean
      member, but already one of the Chief Commanders, and may well aspire one
      day to hold the batoon of Grand Master. The poor soldiers of the Temple
      will not alone place their foot upon the necks of kings&mdash;a
      hemp-sandall'd monk can do that. Our mailed step shall ascend their throne&mdash;our
      gauntlet shall wrench the sceptre from their gripe. Not the reign of your
      vainly-expected Messiah offers such power to your dispersed tribes as my
      ambition may aim at. I have sought but a kindred spirit to share it, and I
      have found such in thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sayest thou this to one of my people?&rdquo; answered Rebecca. &ldquo;Bethink thee&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me not,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;by urging the difference of our
      creeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in
      derision. Think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our
      founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of dying
      martyrs by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by the swords of
      savages, while they vainly strove to defend a barren desert, valuable only
      in the eyes of superstition. Our Order soon adopted bolder and wider
      views, and found out a better indemnification for our sacrifices. Our
      immense possessions in every kingdom of Europe, our high military fame,
      which brings within our circle the flower of chivalry from every Christian
      clime&mdash;these are dedicated to ends of which our pious founders little
      dreamed, and which are equally concealed from such weak spirits as embrace
      our Order on the ancient principles, and whose superstition makes them our
      passive tools. But I will not further withdraw the veil of our mysteries.
      That bugle-sound announces something which may require my presence. Think
      on what I have said.&mdash;Farewell!&mdash;I do not say forgive me the
      violence I have threatened, for it was necessary to the display of thy
      character. Gold can be only known by the application of the touchstone. I
      will soon return, and hold further conference with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving Rebecca
      scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which she had been
      so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold bad man in
      whose power she found herself so unhappily placed. When she entered the
      turret-chamber, her first duty was to return thanks to the God of Jacob
      for the protection which he had afforded her, and to implore its
      continuance for her and for her father. Another name glided into her
      petition&mdash;it was that of the wounded Christian, whom fate had placed
      in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. Her heart indeed
      checked her, as if, even in communing with the Deity in prayer, she
      mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate hers
      could have no alliance&mdash;a Nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. But
      the petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices of
      her sect induce Rebecca to wish it recalled.

</pre>
    <p>
      When the Templar reached the hall of the castle, he found De Bracy already
      there. &ldquo;Your love-suit,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;hath, I suppose, been disturbed,
      like mine, by this obstreperous summons. But you have come later and more
      reluctantly, and therefore I presume your interview has proved more
      agreeable than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the Saxon heiress?&rdquo; said
      the Templar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bones of Thomas a Becket,&rdquo; answered De Bracy, &ldquo;the Lady Rowena
      must have heard that I cannot endure the sight of women's tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away!&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;thou a leader of a Free Company, and regard a
      woman's tears! A few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the flame
      blaze the brighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,&rdquo; replied De Bracy; &ldquo;but
      this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. Never was such
      wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of St
      Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer told us. <a href="#linknote-30"      name="linknoteref-30" id="linknoteref-30"><small>30</small></a> A
      water-fiend hath possessed the fair Saxon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the Jewess,&rdquo; replied the
      Templar; &ldquo;for, I think no single one, not even Apollyon himself, could
      have inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.&mdash;But where is
      Front-de-Boeuf? That horn is sounded more and more clamorously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is negotiating with the Jew, I suppose,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, coolly;
      &ldquo;probably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle. Thou
      mayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his
      treasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-Boeuf is like to offer,
      will raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and
      trumpets to boot. But we will make the vassals call him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were soon after joined by Front-de-Boeuf, who had been disturbed in
      his tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted,
      and had only tarried to give some necessary directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see the cause of this cursed clamour,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf&mdash;&ldquo;here
      is a letter, and, if I mistake not, it is in Saxon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really some
      hopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the paper, and
      then handed it to De Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be magic spells for aught I know,&rdquo; said De Bracy, who possessed
      his full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry of
      the period. &ldquo;Our chaplain attempted to teach me to write,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
      all my letters were formed like spear-heads and sword-blades, and so the
      old shaveling gave up the task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; said the Templar. &ldquo;We have that of the priestly character,
      that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us profit by your most reverend knowledge, then,&rdquo; said De Bracy;
      &ldquo;what says the scroll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a formal letter of defiance,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;but, by our
      Lady of Bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the most
      extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a
      baronial castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest!&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;I would gladly know who dares jest with me
      in such a matter!&mdash;Read it, Sir Brian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Templar accordingly read it as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I, Wamba, the son of
      Witless, Jester to a noble and free-born man, Cedric of Rotherwood, called
      the Saxon,&mdash;And I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, the swineherd&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art mad,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, interrupting the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Luke, it is so set down,&rdquo; answered the Templar. Then resuming his
      task, he went on,&mdash;&ldquo;I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, swineherd unto the
      said Cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates, who make
      common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good knight, called for
      the present 'Le Noir Faineant', and the stout yeoman, Robert Locksley,
      called Cleave-the-Wand. Do you, Reginald Front de-Boeuf, and your allies
      and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you have, without cause
      given or feud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized upon the person
      of our lord and master the said Cedric; also upon the person of a noble
      and freeborn damsel, the Lady Rowena of Hargottstandstede; also upon the
      person of a noble and freeborn man, Athelstane of Coningsburgh; also upon
      the persons of certain freeborn men, their 'cnichts'; also upon certain
      serfs, their born bondsmen; also upon a certain Jew, named Isaac of York,
      together with his daughter, a Jewess, and certain horses and mules: Which
      noble persons, with their 'cnichts' and slaves, and also with the horses
      and mules, Jew and Jewess beforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty,
      and travelling as liege subjects upon the king's highway; therefore we
      require and demand that the said noble persons, namely, Cedric of
      Rotherwood, Rowena of Hargottstandstede, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, with
      their servants, 'cnichts', and followers, also the horses and mules, Jew
      and Jewess aforesaid, together with all goods and chattels to them
      pertaining, be, within an hour after the delivery hereof, delivered to us,
      or to those whom we shall appoint to receive the same, and that untouched
      and unharmed in body and goods. Failing of which, we do pronounce to you,
      that we hold ye as robbers and traitors, and will wager our bodies against
      ye in battle, siege, or otherwise, and do our utmost to your annoyance and
      destruction. Wherefore may God have you in his keeping.&mdash;Signed by us
      upon the eve of St Withold's day, under the great trysting oak in the
      Hart-hill Walk, the above being written by a holy man, Clerk to God, our
      Lady, and St Dunstan, in the Chapel of Copmanhurst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a rude
      sketch of a cock's head and comb, with a legend expressing this
      hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of Wamba, son of Witless. Under this
      respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of Gurth, the son
      of Beowulph. Then was written, in rough bold characters, the words, &ldquo;Le
      Noir Faineant&rdquo;. And, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough drawn,
      was described as the mark of the yeoman Locksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then
      gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to
      know what it could portend. De Bracy was the first to break silence by an
      uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with more
      moderation, by the Templar. Front-de-Boeuf, on the contrary, seemed
      impatient of their ill-timed jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you plain warning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fair sirs, that you had better
      consult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, than give way to
      such misplaced merriment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Front-de-Boeuf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow,&rdquo;
       said De Bracy to the Templar; &ldquo;he is cowed at the very idea of a cartel,
      though it come but from a fool and a swineherd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St Michael,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;I would thou couldst stand the
      whole brunt of this adventure thyself, De Bracy. These fellows dared not
      have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not been supported
      by some strong bands. There are enough of outlaws in this forest to resent
      my protecting the deer. I did but tie one fellow, who was taken redhanded
      and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag, which gored him to death in
      five minutes, and I had as many arrows shot at me as there were launched
      against yonder target at Ashby.&mdash;Here, fellow,&rdquo; he added, to one of
      his attendants, &ldquo;hast thou sent out to see by what force this precious
      challenge is to be supported?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods,&rdquo; answered a
      squire who was in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a proper matter!&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;this comes of lending you
      the use of my castle, that cannot manage your undertaking quietly, but you
      must bring this nest of hornets about my ears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of hornets?&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;of stingless drones rather; a band of lazy
      knaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venison rather than labour
      for their maintenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stingless!&rdquo; replied Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;fork-headed shafts of a cloth-yard
      in length, and these shot within the breadth of a French crown, are sting
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Sir Knight!&rdquo; said the Templar. &ldquo;Let us summon our people, and
      sally forth upon them. One knight&mdash;ay, one man-at-arms, were enough
      for twenty such peasants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, and too much,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I should only be ashamed to couch
      lance against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;were they black Turks or Moors, Sir
      Templar, or the craven peasants of France, most valiant De Bracy; but
      these are English yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save what
      we may derive from our arms and horses, which will avail us little in the
      glades of the forest. Sally, saidst thou? we have scarce men enough to
      defend the castle. The best of mine are at York; so is all your band, De
      Bracy; and we have scarcely twenty, besides the handful that were engaged
      in this mad business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou dost not fear,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;that they can assemble in force
      sufficient to attempt the castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, Sir Brian,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Boeuf. &ldquo;These outlaws have indeed a
      daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders, and experienced
      leaders, my castle may defy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send to thy neighbours,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;let them assemble their
      people, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a jester and
      a swineherd in the baronial castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You jest, Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the baron; &ldquo;but to whom should I send?&mdash;Malvoisin
      is by this time at York with his retainers, and so are my other allies;
      and so should I have been, but for this infernal enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then send to York, and recall our people,&rdquo; said De Bracy. &ldquo;If they abide
      the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my Free Companions, I will
      give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in green-wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who shall bear such a message?&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;they will beset
      every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom.&mdash;I have it,&rdquo; he
      added, after pausing for a moment&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Templar, thou canst write as
      well as read, and if we can but find the writing materials of my chaplain,
      who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his Christmas carousals&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So please ye,&rdquo; said the squire, who was still in attendance, &ldquo;I think old
      Urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of the confessor. He was
      the last man, I have heard her tell, who ever said aught to her, which man
      ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, search them out, Engelred,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;and then, Sir
      Templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather do it at the sword's point than at that of the pen,&rdquo; said
      Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;but be it as you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down accordingly, and indited, in the French language, an epistle
      of the following tenor:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, with his noble
      and knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands of
      slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. If the person calling himself the Black
      Knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought to know
      that he stands degraded by his present association, and has no right to
      ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. Touching the
      prisoners we have made, we do in Christian charity require you to send a
      man of religion, to receive their confession, and reconcile them with God;
      since it is our fixed intention to execute them this morning before noon,
      so that their heads being placed on the battlements, shall show to all men
      how lightly we esteem those who have bestirred themselves in their rescue.
      Wherefore, as above, we require you to send a priest to reconcile them to
      God, in doing which you shall render them the last earthly service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to the
      messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the
      head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established under
      a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the castle.
      Here Wamba and Gurth, with their allies the Black Knight and Locksley, and
      the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to their summons.
      Around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a bold yeoman, whose
      silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed the ordinary nature of
      their occupation. More than two hundred had already assembled, and others
      were fast coming in. Those whom they obeyed as leaders were only
      distinguished from the others by a feather in the cap, their dress, arms,
      and equipments being in all other respects the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting of
      the Saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, as well as many
      bondsmen and servants from Cedric's extensive estate, had already arrived,
      for the purpose of assisting in his rescue. Few of these were armed
      otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes converts to
      military purposes. Boar-spears, scythes, flails, and the like, were their
      chief arms; for the Normans, with the usual policy of conquerors, were
      jealous of permitting to the vanquished Saxons the possession or the use
      of swords and spears. These circumstances rendered the assistance of the
      Saxons far from being so formidable to the besieged, as the strength of
      the men themselves, their superior numbers, and the animation inspired by
      a just cause, might otherwise well have made them. It was to the leaders
      of this motley army that the letter of the Templar was now delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the crook of St Dunstan,&rdquo; said that worthy ecclesiastic, &ldquo;which hath
      brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of e'er another
      saint in Paradise, I swear that I cannot expound unto you this jargon,
      which, whether it be French or Arabic, is beyond my guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then gave the letter to Gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed
      it to Wamba. The Jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper
      with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume
      upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to Locksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, I
      might know something of the matter,&rdquo; said the brave yeoman; &ldquo;but as the
      matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that's at
      twelve miles distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be clerk, then,&rdquo; said the Black Knight; and taking the letter from
      Locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the meaning
      in Saxon to his confederates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Execute the noble Cedric!&rdquo; exclaimed Wamba; &ldquo;by the rood, thou must be
      mistaken, Sir Knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, my worthy friend,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;I have explained the words
      as they are here set down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by St Thomas of Canterbury,&rdquo; replied Gurth, &ldquo;we will have the
      castle, should we tear it down with our hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have nothing else to tear it with,&rdquo; replied Wamba; &ldquo;but mine are
      scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis but a contrivance to gain time,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;they dare not do a
      deed for which I could exact a fearful penalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;there were some one among us who could
      obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands with
      the besieged. Methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent, this holy
      hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure us the
      information we desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plague on thee, and thy advice!&rdquo; said the pious hermit; &ldquo;I tell thee,
      Sir Slothful Knight, that when I doff my friar's frock, my priesthood, my
      sanctity, my very Latin, are put off along with it; and when in my green
      jerkin, I can better kill twenty deer than confess one Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;I fear greatly, there is no one here
      that is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character of
      father confessor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All looked on each other, and were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Wamba, after a short pause, &ldquo;that the fool must be still the
      fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from. You must
      know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that I wore russet before I wore
      motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever came upon me and
      left me just wit enough to be a fool. I trust, with the assistance of the
      good hermit's frock, together with the priesthood, sanctity, and learning
      which are stitched into the cowl of it, I shall be found qualified to
      administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our worthy master Cedric,
      and his companions in adversity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath he sense enough, thinkst thou?&rdquo; said the Black Knight, addressing
      Gurth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Gurth; &ldquo;but if he hath not, it will be the first time
      he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On with the frock, then, good fellow,&rdquo; quoth the Knight, &ldquo;and let thy
      master send us an account of their situation within the castle. Their
      numbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible by a
      sudden and bold attack. Time wears&mdash;away with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in the meantime,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;we will beset the place so
      closely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. So that,
      my good friend,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Wamba, &ldquo;thou mayst assure these
      tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the persons of their
      prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pax vobiscum,&rdquo; said Wamba, who was now muffled in his religious disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar,
      and departed to execute his mission.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The hottest horse will oft be cool,
     The dullest will show fire;
     The friar will often play the fool,
     The fool will play the friar.
     &mdash;Old Song
</pre>
    <p>
      When the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having
      his knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the portal of the
      castle of Front-de-Boeuf, the warder demanded of him his name and errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pax vobiscum,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;I am a poor brother of the Order of
      St Francis, who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy prisoners
      now secured within this castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a bold friar,&rdquo; said the warder, &ldquo;to come hither, where, saving
      our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed these
      twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle,&rdquo; answered the
      pretended friar; &ldquo;trust me it will find good acceptance with him, and the
      cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gramercy,&rdquo; said the warder; &ldquo;but if I come to shame for leaving my post
      upon thine errand, I will try whether a friar's grey gown be proof against
      a grey-goose shaft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the castle
      his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the gate and
      demanded instant admission. With no small wonder he received his master's
      commands to admit the holy man immediately; and, having previously manned
      the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed, without further
      scruple, the commands which he had received. The harebrained self-conceit
      which had emboldened Wamba to undertake this dangerous office, was scarce
      sufficient to support him when he found himself in the presence of a man
      so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, and he
      brought out his &ldquo;pax vobiscum&rdquo;, to which he, in a good measure, trusted
      for supporting his character, with more anxiety and hesitation than had
      hitherto accompanied it. But Front-de-Boeuf was accustomed to see men of
      all ranks tremble in his presence, so that the timidity of the supposed
      father did not give him any cause of suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who and whence art thou, priest?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pax vobiscum',&rdquo; reiterated the Jester, &ldquo;I am a poor servant of St
      Francis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have fallen among
      thieves, (as Scripture hath it,) 'quidam viator incidit in latrones',
      which thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my ghostly
      office on two persons condemned by your honourable justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, right,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;and canst thou tell me, holy
      father, the number of those banditti?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gallant sir,&rdquo; answered the Jester, &ldquo;'nomen illis legio', their name is
      legion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak and
      cord will ill protect thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the supposed friar, &ldquo;'cor meum eructavit', that is to say, I
      was like to burst with fear! but I conceive they may be&mdash;what of
      yeomen&mdash;what of commons, at least five hundred men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Templar, who came into the hall that moment, &ldquo;muster the
      wasps so thick here? it is time to stifle such a mischievous brood.&rdquo; Then
      taking Front-de-Boeuf aside &ldquo;Knowest thou the priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a stranger from a distant convent,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;I know
      him not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then trust him not with thy purpose in words,&rdquo; answered the Templar. &ldquo;Let
      him carry a written order to De Bracy's company of Free Companions, to
      repair instantly to their master's aid. In the meantime, and that the
      shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely about his task of
      preparing these Saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be so,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf. And he forthwith appointed a
      domestic to conduct Wamba to the apartment where Cedric and Athelstane
      were confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impatience of Cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his
      confinement. He walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the
      attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach of
      a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes
      addressing Athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of the
      adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great composure, the liberal
      meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly interesting himself about
      the duration of his captivity, which he concluded, would, like all earthly
      evils, find an end in Heaven's good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pax vobiscum',&rdquo; said the Jester, entering the apartment; &ldquo;the blessing
      of St Dunstan, St Dennis, St Duthoc, and all other saints whatsoever, be
      upon ye and about ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter freely,&rdquo; answered Cedric to the supposed friar; &ldquo;with what intent
      art thou come hither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bid you prepare yourselves for death,&rdquo; answered the Jester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible!&rdquo; replied Cedric, starting. &ldquo;Fearless and wicked as they
      are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;to restrain them by their sense of humanity, is
      the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread. Bethink
      thee, therefore, noble Cedric, and you also, gallant Athelstane, what
      crimes you have committed in the flesh; for this very day will ye be
      called to answer at a higher tribunal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearest thou this, Athelstane?&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;we must rouse up our hearts
      to this last action, since better it is we should die like men, than live
      like slaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;to stand the worst of their malice,
      and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever I did to my
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us then unto our holy gear, father,&rdquo; said Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait yet a moment, good uncle,&rdquo; said the Jester, in his natural tone;
      &ldquo;better look long before you leap in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;I should know that voice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that of your trusty slave and jester,&rdquo; answered Wamba, throwing
      back his cowl. &ldquo;Had you taken a fool's advice formerly, you would not have
      been here at all. Take a fool's advice now, and you will not be here
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How mean'st thou, knave?&rdquo; answered the Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even thus,&rdquo; replied Wamba; &ldquo;take thou this frock and cord, which are all
      the orders I ever had, and march quietly out of the castle, leaving me
      your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave thee in my stead!&rdquo; said Cedric, astonished at the proposal; &ldquo;why,
      they would hang thee, my poor knave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;E'en let them do as they are permitted,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;I trust&mdash;no
      disparagement to your birth&mdash;that the son of Witless may hang in a
      chain with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the
      alderman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Wamba,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;for one thing will I grant thy request.
      And that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with Lord
      Athelstane instead of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by St Dunstan,&rdquo; answered Wamba; &ldquo;there were little reason in that.
      Good right there is, that the son of Witless should suffer to save the son
      of Hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the benefit of
      one whose fathers were strangers to his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;the fathers of Athelstane were monarchs of
      England!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might be whomsoever they pleased,&rdquo; replied Wamba; &ldquo;but my neck
      stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their sake.
      Wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me
      to leave this dungeon as free as I entered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the old tree wither,&rdquo; continued Cedric, &ldquo;so the stately hope of the
      forest be preserved. Save the noble Athelstane, my trusty Wamba! it is the
      duty of each who has Saxon blood in his veins. Thou and I will abide
      together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and
      safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, father Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane, grasping his hand,&mdash;for,
      when roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming
      his high race&mdash;&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;I would rather remain in this
      hall a week without food save the prisoner's stinted loaf, or drink save
      the prisoner's measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to escape
      which the slave's untaught kindness has purveyed for his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are called wise men, sirs,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;and I a crazed fool;
      but, uncle Cedric, and cousin Athelstane, the fool shall decide this
      controversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any
      farther. I am like John-a-Duck's mare, that will let no man mount her but
      John-a-Duck. I came to save my master, and if he will not consent&mdash;basta&mdash;I
      can but go away home again. Kind service cannot be chucked from hand to
      hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. I'll hang for no man but my own
      born master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, then, noble Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;neglect not this opportunity.
      Your presence without may encourage friends to our rescue&mdash;your
      remaining here would ruin us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?&rdquo; said Cedric,
      looking to the Jester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prospect, indeed!&rdquo; echoed Wamba; &ldquo;let me tell you, when you fill my
      cloak, you are wrapped in a general's cassock. Five hundred men are there
      without, and I was this morning one of the chief leaders. My fool's cap
      was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. Well, we shall see what good they
      will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. Truly, I fear they will
      lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. And so farewell, master,
      and be kind to poor Gurth and his dog Fangs; and let my cockscomb hang in
      the hall at Rotherwood, in memory that I flung away my life for my master,
      like a faithful&mdash;-fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest and
      earnest. The tears stood in Cedric's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy memory shall be preserved,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;while fidelity and affection
      have honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall find the means of saving
      Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and thee, also, my poor Wamba, thou shouldst
      not overbear me in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck
      Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no language,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but my own, and a few words of their
      mincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverend brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spell lies in two words,&rdquo; replied Wamba&mdash;&ldquo;'Pax vobiscum' will
      answer all queries. If you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, 'Pax
      vobiscum' carries you through it all. It is as useful to a friar as a
      broomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. Speak it but thus, in a
      deep grave tone,&mdash;'Pax vobiscum!'&mdash;it is irresistible&mdash;Watch
      and ward, knight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them
      all. I think, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to
      be doubted they may, I will try its weight upon the finisher of the
      sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If such prove the case,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;my religious orders are soon
      taken&mdash;'Pax vobiscum'. I trust I shall remember the pass-word.&mdash;Noble
      Athelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor boy, whose heart might make
      amends for a weaker head&mdash;I will save you, or return and die with
      you. The royal blood of our Saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine
      beats in my veins; nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind knave
      who risked himself for his master, if Cedric's peril can prevent it.&mdash;Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, noble Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane; &ldquo;remember it is the true part
      of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, uncle,&rdquo; added Wamba; &ldquo;and remember 'Pax vobiscum'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, Cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not
      long ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his Jester
      had recommended as omnipotent. In a low-arched and dusky passage, by which
      he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle, he was
      interrupted by a female form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pax vobiscum!'&rdquo; said the pseudo friar, and was endeavouring to hurry
      past, when a soft voice replied, &ldquo;'Et vobis&mdash;quaso, domine
      reverendissime, pro misericordia vestra'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am somewhat deaf,&rdquo; replied Cedric, in good Saxon, and at the same time
      muttered to himself, &ldquo;A curse on the fool and his 'Pax vobiscum!' I have
      lost my javelin at the first cast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf of
      his Latin ear, and this the person who now addressed Cedric knew full
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you of dear love, reverend father,&rdquo; she replied in his own
      language, &ldquo;that you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort a
      wounded prisoner of this castle, and have such compassion upon him and us
      as thy holy office teaches&mdash;Never shall good deed so highly advantage
      thy convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; answered Cedric, much embarrassed, &ldquo;my time in this castle
      will not permit me to exercise the duties of mine office&mdash;I must
      presently forth&mdash;there is life and death upon my speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, father, let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you,&rdquo;
       replied the suppliant, &ldquo;not to leave the oppressed and endangered without
      counsel or succour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the fiend fly away with me, and leave me in Ifrin with the souls of
      Odin and of Thor!&rdquo; answered Cedric impatiently, and would probably have
      proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual
      character, when the colloquy was interrupted by the harsh voice of
      Urfried, the old crone of the turret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, minion,&rdquo; said she to the female speaker, &ldquo;is this the manner in
      which you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leave thy
      prison-cell yonder?&mdash;Puttest thou the reverend man to use ungracious
      language to free himself from the importunities of a Jewess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Jewess!&rdquo; said Cedric, availing himself of the information to get clear
      of their interruption,&mdash;&ldquo;Let me pass, woman! stop me not at your
      peril. I am fresh from my holy office, and would avoid pollution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way, father,&rdquo; said the old hag, &ldquo;thou art a stranger in this
      castle, and canst not leave it without a guide. Come hither, for I would
      speak with thee.&mdash;And you, daughter of an accursed race, go to the
      sick man's chamber, and tend him until my return; and woe betide you if
      you again quit it without my permission!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca retreated. Her importunities had prevailed upon Urfried to suffer
      her to quit the turret, and Urfried had employed her services where she
      herself would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of the wounded
      Ivanhoe. With an understanding awake to their dangerous situation, and
      prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which occurred, Rebecca
      had hoped something from the presence of a man of religion, who, she
      learned from Urfried, had penetrated into this godless castle. She watched
      the return of the supposed ecclesiastic, with the purpose of addressing
      him, and interesting him in favour of the prisoners; with what imperfect
      success the reader has been just acquainted.

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Fond wretch! and what canst thou relate,
     But deeds of sorrow, shame, and sin?
     Thy deeds are proved&mdash;thou know'st thy fate;
     But come, thy tale&mdash;begin&mdash;begin.
</pre>
    <hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     But I have griefs of other kind,
     Troubles and sorrows more severe;
     Give me to ease my tortured mind,
     Lend to my woes a patient ear;
     And let me, if I may not find
     A friend to help&mdash;find one to hear.
     &mdash;Crabbe's Hall of Justice
</pre>
    <p>
      When Urfried had with clamours and menaces driven Rebecca back to the
      apartment from which she had sallied, she proceeded to conduct the
      unwilling Cedric into a small apartment, the door of which she heedfully
      secured. Then fetching from a cupboard a stoup of wine and two flagons,
      she placed them on the table, and said in a tone rather asserting a fact
      than asking a question, &ldquo;Thou art Saxon, father&mdash;Deny it not,&rdquo; she
      continued, observing that Cedric hastened not to reply; &ldquo;the sounds of my
      native language are sweet to mine ears, though seldom heard save from the
      tongues of the wretched and degraded serfs on whom the proud Normans
      impose the meanest drudgery of this dwelling. Thou art a Saxon, father&mdash;a
      Saxon, and, save as thou art a servant of God, a freeman.&mdash;Thine
      accents are sweet in mine ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not Saxon priests visit this castle, then?&rdquo; replied Cedric; &ldquo;it were,
      methinks, their duty to comfort the outcast and oppressed children of the
      soil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They come not&mdash;or if they come, they better love to revel at the
      boards of their conquerors,&rdquo; answered Urfried, &ldquo;than to hear the groans of
      their countrymen&mdash;so, at least, report speaks of them&mdash;of myself
      I can say little. This castle, for ten years, has opened to no priest save
      the debauched Norman chaplain who partook the nightly revels of
      Front-de-Boeuf, and he has been long gone to render an account of his
      stewardship.&mdash;But thou art a Saxon&mdash;a Saxon priest, and I have
      one question to ask of thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Saxon,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;but unworthy, surely, of the name of
      priest. Let me begone on my way&mdash;I swear I will return, or send one
      of our fathers more worthy to hear your confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay yet a while,&rdquo; said Urfried; &ldquo;the accents of the voice which thou
      hearest now will soon be choked with the cold earth, and I would not
      descend to it like the beast I have lived. But wine must give me strength
      to tell the horrors of my tale.&rdquo; She poured out a cup, and drank it with a
      frightful avidity, which seemed desirous of draining the last drop in the
      goblet. &ldquo;It stupifies,&rdquo; she said, looking upwards as she finished her
      drought, &ldquo;but it cannot cheer&mdash;Partake it, father, if you would hear
      my tale without sinking down upon the pavement.&rdquo; Cedric would have avoided
      pledging her in this ominous conviviality, but the sign which she made to
      him expressed impatience and despair. He complied with her request, and
      answered her challenge in a large wine-cup; she then proceeded with her
      story, as if appeased by his complaisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not born,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;father, the wretch that thou now seest me. I
      was free, was happy, was honoured, loved, and was beloved. I am now a
      slave, miserable and degraded&mdash;the sport of my masters' passions
      while I had yet beauty&mdash;the object of their contempt, scorn, and
      hatred, since it has passed away. Dost thou wonder, father, that I should
      hate mankind, and, above all, the race that has wrought this change in me?
      Can the wrinkled decrepit hag before thee, whose wrath must vent itself in
      impotent curses, forget she was once the daughter of the noble Thane of
      Torquilstone, before whose frown a thousand vassals trembled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou the daughter of Torquil Wolfganger!&rdquo; said Cedric, receding as he
      spoke; &ldquo;thou&mdash;thou&mdash;the daughter of that noble Saxon, my
      father's friend and companion in arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy father's friend!&rdquo; echoed Urfried; &ldquo;then Cedric called the Saxon
      stands before me, for the noble Hereward of Rotherwood had but one son,
      whose name is well known among his countrymen. But if thou art Cedric of
      Rotherwood, why this religious dress?&mdash;hast thou too despaired of
      saving thy country, and sought refuge from oppression in the shade of the
      convent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters not who I am,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;proceed, unhappy woman, with thy
      tale of horror and guilt!&mdash;Guilt there must be&mdash;there is guilt
      even in thy living to tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is&mdash;there is,&rdquo; answered the wretched woman, &ldquo;deep, black,
      damning guilt,&mdash;guilt, that lies like a load at my breast&mdash;guilt,
      that all the penitential fires of hereafter cannot cleanse.&mdash;Yes, in
      these halls, stained with the noble and pure blood of my father and my
      brethren&mdash;in these very halls, to have lived the paramour of their
      murderer, the slave at once and the partaker of his pleasures, was to
      render every breath which I drew of vital air, a crime and a curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched woman!&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric. &ldquo;And while the friends of thy father&mdash;while
      each true Saxon heart, as it breathed a requiem for his soul, and those of
      his valiant sons, forgot not in their prayers the murdered Ulrica&mdash;while
      all mourned and honoured the dead, thou hast lived to merit our hate and
      execration&mdash;lived to unite thyself with the vile tyrant who murdered
      thy nearest and dearest&mdash;who shed the blood of infancy, rather than a
      male of the noble house of Torquil Wolfganger should survive&mdash;with
      him hast thou lived to unite thyself, and in the hands of lawless love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In lawless hands, indeed, but not in those of love!&rdquo; answered the hag;
      &ldquo;love will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom, than those unhallowed
      vaults.&mdash;No, with that at least I cannot reproach myself&mdash;hatred
      to Front-de-Boeuf and his race governed my soul most deeply, even in the
      hour of his guilty endearments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hated him, and yet you lived,&rdquo; replied Cedric; &ldquo;wretch! was there no
      poniard&mdash;no knife&mdash;no bodkin!&mdash;Well was it for thee, since
      thou didst prize such an existence, that the secrets of a Norman castle
      are like those of the grave. For had I but dreamed of the daughter of
      Torquil living in foul communion with the murderer of her father, the
      sword of a true Saxon had found thee out even in the arms of thy
      paramour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of Torquil?&rdquo; said
      Ulrica, for we may now lay aside her assumed name of Urfried; &ldquo;thou art
      then the true Saxon report speaks thee! for even within these accursed
      walls, where, as thou well sayest, guilt shrouds itself in inscrutable
      mystery, even there has the name of Cedric been sounded&mdash;and I,
      wretched and degraded, have rejoiced to think that there yet breathed an
      avenger of our unhappy nation.&mdash;I also have had my hours of vengeance&mdash;I
      have fomented the quarrels of our foes, and heated drunken revelry into
      murderous broil&mdash;I have seen their blood flow&mdash;I have heard
      their dying groans!&mdash;Look on me, Cedric&mdash;are there not still
      left on this foul and faded face some traces of the features of Torquil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me not of them, Ulrica,&rdquo; replied Cedric, in a tone of grief mixed
      with abhorrence; &ldquo;these traces form such a resemblance as arises from the
      graves of the dead, when a fiend has animated the lifeless corpse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; answered Ulrica; &ldquo;yet wore these fiendish features the mask of
      a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance the elder
      Front-de-Boeuf and his son Reginald! The darkness of hell should hide what
      followed, but revenge must lift the veil, and darkly intimate what it
      would raise the dead to speak aloud. Long had the smouldering fire of
      discord glowed between the tyrant father and his savage son&mdash;long had
      I nursed, in secret, the unnatural hatred&mdash;it blazed forth in an hour
      of drunken wassail, and at his own board fell my oppressor by the hand of
      his own son&mdash;such are the secrets these vaults conceal!&mdash;Rend
      asunder, ye accursed arches,&rdquo; she added, looking up towards the roof, &ldquo;and
      bury in your fall all who are conscious of the hideous mystery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou, creature of guilt and misery,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;what became thy
      lot on the death of thy ravisher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess it, but ask it not.&mdash;Here&mdash;here I dwelt, till age,
      premature age, has stamped its ghastly features on my countenance&mdash;scorned
      and insulted where I was once obeyed, and compelled to bound the revenge
      which had once such ample scope, to the efforts of petty malice of a
      discontented menial, or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hag&mdash;condemned
      to hear from my lonely turret the sounds of revelry in which I once
      partook, or the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ulrica,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;with a heart which still, I fear, regrets the lost
      reward of thy crimes, as much as the deeds by which thou didst acquire
      that meed, how didst thou dare to address thee to one who wears this robe?
      Consider, unhappy woman, what could the sainted Edward himself do for
      thee, were he here in bodily presence? The royal Confessor was endowed by
      heaven with power to cleanse the ulcers of the body, but only God himself
      can cure the leprosy of the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, turn not from me, stern prophet of wrath,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;but tell
      me, if thou canst, in what shall terminate these new and awful feelings
      that burst on my solitude&mdash;Why do deeds, long since done, rise before
      me in new and irresistible horrors? What fate is prepared beyond the grave
      for her, to whom God has assigned on earth a lot of such unspeakable
      wretchedness? Better had I turn to Woden, Hertha, and Zernebock&mdash;to
      Mista, and to Skogula, the gods of our yet unbaptized ancestors, than
      endure the dreadful anticipations which have of late haunted my waking and
      my sleeping hours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no priest,&rdquo; said Cedric, turning with disgust from this miserable
      picture of guilt, wretchedness, and despair; &ldquo;I am no priest, though I
      wear a priest's garment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Priest or layman,&rdquo; answered Ulrica, &ldquo;thou art the first I have seen for
      twenty years, by whom God was feared or man regarded; and dost thou bid me
      despair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bid thee repent,&rdquo; said Cedric. &ldquo;Seek to prayer and penance, and mayest
      thou find acceptance! But I cannot, I will not, longer abide with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay yet a moment!&rdquo; said Ulrica; &ldquo;leave me not now, son of my father's
      friend, lest the demon who has governed my life should tempt me to avenge
      myself of thy hard-hearted scorn&mdash;Thinkest thou, if Front-de-Boeuf
      found Cedric the Saxon in his castle, in such a disguise, that thy life
      would be a long one?&mdash;Already his eye has been upon thee like a
      falcon on his prey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be it so,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;and let him tear me with beak and talons,
      ere my tongue say one word which my heart doth not warrant. I will die a
      Saxon&mdash;true in word, open in deed&mdash;I bid thee avaunt!&mdash;touch
      me not, stay me not!&mdash;The sight of Front-de-Boeuf himself is less
      odious to me than thou, degraded and degenerate as thou art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Ulrica, no longer interrupting him; &ldquo;go thy way, and
      forget, in the insolence of thy superority, that the wretch before thee is
      the daughter of thy father's friend.&mdash;Go thy way&mdash;if I am
      separated from mankind by my sufferings&mdash;separated from those whose
      aid I might most justly expect&mdash;not less will I be separated from
      them in my revenge!&mdash;No man shall aid me, but the ears of all men
      shall tingle to hear of the deed which I shall dare to do!&mdash;Farewell!&mdash;thy
      scorn has burst the last tie which seemed yet to unite me to my kind&mdash;a
      thought that my woes might claim the compassion of my people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ulrica,&rdquo; said Cedric, softened by this appeal, &ldquo;hast thou borne up and
      endured to live through so much guilt and so much misery, and wilt thou
      now yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes, and when
      repentance were thy fitter occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cedric,&rdquo; answered Ulrica, &ldquo;thou little knowest the human heart. To act as
      I have acted, to think as I have thought, requires the maddening love of
      pleasure, mingled with the keen appetite of revenge, the proud
      consciousness of power; droughts too intoxicating for the human heart to
      bear, and yet retain the power to prevent. Their force has long passed
      away&mdash;Age has no pleasures, wrinkles have no influence, revenge
      itself dies away in impotent curses. Then comes remorse, with all its
      vipers, mixed with vain regrets for the past, and despair for the future!&mdash;Then,
      when all other strong impulses have ceased, we become like the fiends in
      hell, who may feel remorse, but never repentance.&mdash;But thy words have
      awakened a new soul within me&mdash;Well hast thou said, all is possible
      for those who dare to die!&mdash;Thou hast shown me the means of revenge,
      and be assured I will embrace them. It has hitherto shared this wasted
      bosom with other and with rival passions&mdash;henceforward it shall
      possess me wholly, and thou thyself shalt say, that, whatever was the life
      of Ulrica, her death well became the daughter of the noble Torquil. There
      is a force without beleaguering this accursed castle&mdash;hasten to lead
      them to the attack, and when thou shalt see a red flag wave from the
      turret on the eastern angle of the donjon, press the Normans hard&mdash;they
      will then have enough to do within, and you may win the wall in spite both
      of bow and mangonel.&mdash;Begone, I pray thee&mdash;follow thine own
      fate, and leave me to mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which she thus darkly
      announced, but the stern voice of Front-de-Boeuf was heard, exclaiming,
      &ldquo;Where tarries this loitering priest? By the scallop-shell of Compostella,
      I will make a martyr of him, if he loiters here to hatch treason among my
      domestics!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a true prophet,&rdquo; said Ulrica, &ldquo;is an evil conscience! But heed him
      not&mdash;out and to thy people&mdash;Cry your Saxon onslaught, and let
      them sing their war-song of Rollo, if they will; vengeance shall bear a
      burden to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she thus spoke, she vanished through a private door, and Reginald
      Front-de-Boeuf entered the apartment. Cedric, with some difficulty,
      compelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty Baron, who returned his
      courtesy with a slight inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy penitents, father, have made a long shrift&mdash;it is the better for
      them, since it is the last they shall ever make. Hast thou prepared them
      for death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found them,&rdquo; said Cedric, in such French as he could command,
      &ldquo;expecting the worst, from the moment they knew into whose power they had
      fallen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, Sir Friar,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;thy speech, methinks,
      smacks of a Saxon tongue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was bred in the convent of St Withold of Burton,&rdquo; answered Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; said the Baron; &ldquo;it had been better for thee to have been a Norman,
      and better for my purpose too; but need has no choice of messengers. That
      St Withold's of Burton is an owlet's nest worth the harrying. The day will
      soon come that the frock shall protect the Saxon as little as the
      mail-coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's will be done,&rdquo; said Cedric, in a voice tremulous with passion,
      which Front-de-Boeuf imputed to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou dreamest already that our men-at-arms are in thy
      refectory and thy ale-vaults. But do me one cast of thy holy office, and,
      come what list of others, thou shalt sleep as safe in thy cell as a snail
      within his shell of proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak your commands,&rdquo; said Cedric, with suppressed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me through this passage, then, that I may dismiss thee by the
      postern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he strode on his way before the supposed friar, Front-de-Boeuf thus
      schooled him in the part which he desired he should act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou seest, Sir Friar, yon herd of Saxon swine, who have dared to environ
      this castle of Torquilstone&mdash;Tell them whatever thou hast a mind of
      the weakness of this fortalice, or aught else that can detain them before
      it for twenty-four hours. Meantime bear thou this scroll&mdash;But soft&mdash;canst
      read, Sir Priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a jot I,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;save on my breviary; and then I know the
      characters, because I have the holy service by heart, praised be Our Lady
      and St Withold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fitter messenger for my purpose.&mdash;Carry thou this scroll to the
      castle of Philip de Malvoisin; say it cometh from me, and is written by
      the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and that I pray him to send it to York
      with all the speed man and horse can make. Meanwhile, tell him to doubt
      nothing, he shall find us whole and sound behind our battlement&mdash;Shame
      on it, that we should be compelled to hide thus by a pack of runagates,
      who are wont to fly even at the flash of our pennons and the tramp of our
      horses! I say to thee, priest, contrive some cast of thine art to keep the
      knaves where they are, until our friends bring up their lances. My
      vengeance is awake, and she is a falcon that slumbers not till she has
      been gorged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my patron saint,&rdquo; said Cedric, with deeper energy than became his
      character, &ldquo;and by every saint who has lived and died in England, your
      commands shall be obeyed! Not a Saxon shall stir from before these walls,
      if I have art and influence to detain them there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;thou changest thy tone, Sir Priest, and
      speakest brief and bold, as if thy heart were in the slaughter of the
      Saxon herd; and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation, and would at
      this moment have been much the better of a hint from Wamba's more fertile
      brain. But necessity, according to the ancient proverb, sharpens
      invention, and he muttered something under his cowl concerning the men in
      question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Despardieux',&rdquo; answered Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;thou hast spoken the very truth&mdash;I
      forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot, as well as if they had been
      born south of yonder salt channel. Was it not he of St Ives whom they tied
      to an oak-tree, and compelled to sing a mass while they were rifling his
      mails and his wallets?&mdash;No, by our Lady&mdash;that jest was played by
      Gualtier of Middleton, one of our own companions-at-arms. But they were
      Saxons who robbed the chapel at St Bees of cup, candlestick and chalice,
      were they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were godless men,&rdquo; answered Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for
      many a secret carousal, when ye pretend ye are but busied with vigils and
      primes!&mdash;Priest, thou art bound to revenge such sacrilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indeed bound to vengeance,&rdquo; murmured Cedric; &ldquo;Saint Withold knows my
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Front-de-Boeuf, in the meanwhile, led the way to a postern, where, passing
      the moat on a single plank, they reached a small barbican, or exterior
      defence, which communicated with the open field by a well-fortified
      sallyport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begone, then; and if thou wilt do mine errand, and if thou return hither
      when it is done, thou shalt see Saxon flesh cheap as ever was hog's in the
      shambles of Sheffield. And, hark thee, thou seemest to be a jolly
      confessor&mdash;come hither after the onslaught, and thou shalt have as
      much Malvoisie as would drench thy whole convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly we shall meet again,&rdquo; answered Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in hand the whilst,&rdquo; continued the Norman; and, as they parted
      at the postern door, he thrust into Cedric's reluctant hand a gold byzant,
      adding, &ldquo;Remember, I will fly off both cowl and skin, if thou failest in
      thy purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And full leave will I give thee to do both,&rdquo; answered Cedric, leaving the
      postern, and striding forth over the free field with a joyful step, &ldquo;if,
      when we meet next, I deserve not better at thine hand.&rdquo;&mdash;Turning then
      back towards the castle, he threw the piece of gold towards the donor,
      exclaiming at the same time, &ldquo;False Norman, thy money perish with thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Front-de-Boeuf heard the words imperfectly, but the action was suspicious&mdash;&ldquo;Archers,&rdquo;
       he called to the warders on the outward battlements, &ldquo;send me an arrow
      through yon monk's frock!&mdash;yet stay,&rdquo; he said, as his retainers were
      bending their bows, &ldquo;it avails not&mdash;we must thus far trust him since
      we have no better shift. I think he dares not betray me&mdash;at the worst
      I can but treat with these Saxon dogs whom I have safe in kennel.&mdash;Ho!
      Giles jailor, let them bring Cedric of Rotherwood before me, and the other
      churl, his companion&mdash;him I mean of Coningsburgh&mdash;Athelstane
      there, or what call they him? Their very names are an encumbrance to a
      Norman knight's mouth, and have, as it were, a flavour of bacon&mdash;Give
      me a stoup of wine, as jolly Prince John said, that I may wash away the
      relish&mdash;place it in the armoury, and thither lead the prisoners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that Gothic apartment, hung
      with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he found a
      flagon of wine on the massive oaken table, and the two Saxon captives
      under the guard of four of his dependants. Front-de-Boeuf took a long
      drought of wine, and then addressed his prisoners;&mdash;for the manner in
      which Wamba drew the cap over his face, the change of dress, the gloomy
      and broken light, and the Baron's imperfect acquaintance with the features
      of Cedric, (who avoided his Norman neighbours, and seldom stirred beyond
      his own domains,) prevented him from discovering that the most important
      of his captives had made his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gallants of England,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;how relish ye your
      entertainment at Torquilstone?&mdash;Are ye yet aware what your 'surquedy'
      and 'outrecuidance' <a href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31"       id="linknoteref-31"><small>31</small></a> merit, for scoffing at the
      entertainment of a prince of the House of Anjou?&mdash;Have ye forgotten
      how ye requited the unmerited hospitality of the royal John? By God and St
      Dennis, an ye pay not the richer ransom, I will hang ye up by the feet
      from the iron bars of these windows, till the kites and hooded crows have
      made skeletons of you!&mdash;Speak out, ye Saxon dogs&mdash;what bid ye
      for your worthless lives?&mdash;How say you, you of Rotherwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doit I,&rdquo; answered poor Wamba&mdash;&ldquo;and for hanging up by the feet,
      my brain has been topsy-turvy, they say, ever since the biggin was bound
      first round my head; so turning me upside down may peradventure restore it
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Genevieve!&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;what have we got here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with the back of his hand he struck Cedric's cap from the head of the
      Jester, and throwing open his collar, discovered the fatal badge of
      servitude, the silver collar round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giles&mdash;Clement&mdash;dogs and varlets!&rdquo; exclaimed the furious
      Norman, &ldquo;what have you brought me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can tell you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, who just entered the apartment.
      &ldquo;This is Cedric's clown, who fought so manful a skirmish with Isaac of
      York about a question of precedence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall settle it for them both,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;they shall
      hang on the same gallows, unless his master and this boar of Coningsburgh
      will pay well for their lives. Their wealth is the least they can
      surrender; they must also carry off with them the swarms that are
      besetting the castle, subscribe a surrender of their pretended immunities,
      and live under us as serfs and vassals; too happy if, in the new world
      that is about to begin, we leave them the breath of their nostrils.&mdash;Go,&rdquo;
       said he to two of his attendants, &ldquo;fetch me the right Cedric hither, and I
      pardon your error for once; the rather that you but mistook a fool for a
      Saxon franklin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;your chivalrous excellency will find there are
      more fools than franklins among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means the knave?&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, looking towards his
      followers, who, lingering and loath, faltered forth their belief, that if
      this were not Cedric who was there in presence, they knew not what was
      become of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints of Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed De Bracy, &ldquo;he must have escaped in the
      monk's garments!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiends of hell!&rdquo; echoed Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;it was then the boar of
      Rotherwood whom I ushered to the postern, and dismissed with my own hands!&mdash;And
      thou,&rdquo; he said to Wamba, &ldquo;whose folly could overreach the wisdom of idiots
      yet more gross than thyself&mdash;I will give thee holy orders&mdash;I
      will shave thy crown for thee!&mdash;Here, let them tear the scalp from
      his head, and then pitch him headlong from the battlements&mdash;Thy trade
      is to jest, canst thou jest now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deal with me better than your word, noble knight,&rdquo; whimpered forth
      poor Wamba, whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even by the
      immediate prospect of death; &ldquo;if you give me the red cap you propose, out
      of a simple monk you will make a cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor wretch,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;is resolved to die in his vocation.&mdash;Front-de-Boeuf,
      you shall not slay him. Give him to me to make sport for my Free
      Companions.&mdash;How sayst thou, knave? Wilt thou take heart of grace,
      and go to the wars with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, with my master's leave,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;for, look you, I must not slip
      collar&rdquo; (and he touched that which he wore) &ldquo;without his permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a Norman saw will soon cut a Saxon collar.&rdquo; said De Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, noble sir,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;and thence goes the proverb&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Norman saw on English oak,
     On English neck a Norman yoke;
     Norman spoon in English dish,
     And England ruled as Normans wish;
     Blithe world to England never will be more,
     Till England's rid of all the four.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou dost well, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;to stand there listening
      to a fool's jargon, when destruction is gaping for us! Seest thou not we
      are overreached, and that our proposed mode of communicating with our
      friends without has been disconcerted by this same motley gentleman thou
      art so fond to brother? What views have we to expect but instant storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the battlements then,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;when didst thou ever see me the
      graver for the thoughts of battle? Call the Templar yonder, and let him
      fight but half so well for his life as he has done for his Order&mdash;Make
      thou to the walls thyself with thy huge body&mdash;Let me do my poor
      endeavour in my own way, and I tell thee the Saxon outlaws may as well
      attempt to scale the clouds, as the castle of Torquilstone; or, if you
      will treat with the banditti, why not employ the mediation of this worthy
      franklin, who seems in such deep contemplation of the wine-flagon?&mdash;Here,
      Saxon,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Athelstane, and handing the cup to him,
      &ldquo;rinse thy throat with that noble liquor, and rouse up thy soul to say
      what thou wilt do for thy liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man of mould may,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;providing it be what a
      man of manhood ought.&mdash;Dismiss me free, with my companions, and I
      will pay a ransom of a thousand marks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who are
      swarming around the castle, contrary to God's peace and the king's?&rdquo; said
      Front-de-Boeuf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In so far as I can,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, &ldquo;I will withdraw them; and I
      fear not but that my father Cedric will do his best to assist me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are agreed then,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf&mdash;&ldquo;thou and they are to be
      set at freedom, and peace is to be on both sides, for payment of a
      thousand marks. It is a trifling ransom, Saxon, and thou wilt owe
      gratitude to the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your
      persons. But mark, this extends not to the Jew Isaac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to the Jew Isaac's daughter,&rdquo; said the Templar, who had now joined
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;belong to this Saxon's company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I were unworthy to be called Christian, if they did,&rdquo; replied Athelstane:
      &ldquo;deal with the unbelievers as ye list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither does the ransom include the Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said De Bracy. &ldquo;It
      shall never be said I was scared out of a fair prize without striking a
      blow for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;does our treaty refer to this wretched
      Jester, whom I retain, that I may make him an example to every knave who
      turns jest into earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; answered Athelstane, with the most steady countenance,
      &ldquo;is my affianced bride. I will be drawn by wild horses before I consent to
      part with her. The slave Wamba has this day saved the life of my father
      Cedric&mdash;I will lose mine ere a hair of his head be injured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy affianced bride?&mdash;The Lady Rowena the affianced bride of a
      vassal like thee?&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;Saxon, thou dreamest that the days of
      thy seven kingdoms are returned again. I tell thee, the Princes of the
      House of Anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lineage, proud Norman,&rdquo; replied Athelstane, &ldquo;is drawn from a source
      more pure and ancient than that of a beggarly Frenchman, whose living is
      won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his paltry
      standard. Kings were my ancestors, strong in war and wise in council, who
      every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou canst number
      individual followers; whose names have been sung by minstrels, and their
      laws recorded by Wittenagemotes; whose bones were interred amid the
      prayers of saints, and over whose tombs minsters have been builded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast it, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, well pleased with the
      rebuff which his companion had received; &ldquo;the Saxon hath hit thee fairly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As fairly as a captive can strike,&rdquo; said De Bracy, with apparent
      carelessness; &ldquo;for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at
      freedom.&mdash;But thy glibness of reply, comrade,&rdquo; rejoined he, speaking
      to Athelstane, &ldquo;will not win the freedom of the Lady Rowena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his
      custom to do on any topic, however interesting, returned no answer. The
      conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced
      that a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of Saint Bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,&rdquo; said
      Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;have we a real monk this time, or another impostor?
      Search him, slaves&mdash;for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed
      upon you, I will have your eyes torn out, and hot coals put into the
      sockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me endure the extremity of your anger, my lord,&rdquo; said Giles, &ldquo;if this
      be not a real shaveling. Your squire Jocelyn knows him well, and will
      vouch him to be brother Ambrose, a monk in attendance upon the Prior of
      Jorvaulx.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;most likely he brings us news from his
      jovial master. Surely the devil keeps holiday, and the priests are
      relieved from duty, that they are strolling thus wildly through the
      country. Remove these prisoners; and, Saxon, think on what thou hast
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I claim,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;an honourable imprisonment, with due care of
      my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and as is due to one who is
      in treaty for ransom. Moreover, I hold him that deems himself the best of
      you, bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on my
      freedom. This defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer; thou
      underliest it, and art bound to answer me&mdash;There lies my glove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answer not the challenge of my prisoner,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;nor
      shalt thou, Maurice de Bracy.&mdash;Giles,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;hang the
      franklin's glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers: there shall it
      remain until he is a free man. Should he then presume to demand it, or to
      affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of Saint
      Christopher, he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe on
      foot or on horseback, alone or with his vassals at his back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced the
      monk Ambrose, who appeared to be in great perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the real 'Deus vobiscum',&rdquo; said Wamba, as he passed the reverend
      brother; &ldquo;the others were but counterfeits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Mother,&rdquo; said the monk, as he addressed the assembled knights, &ldquo;I am
      at last safe and in Christian keeping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe thou art,&rdquo; replied De Bracy; &ldquo;and for Christianity, here is the
      stout Baron Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, whose utter abomination is a Jew; and
      the good Knight Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whose trade is to slay
      Saracens&mdash;If these are not good marks of Christianity, I know no
      other which they bear about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye are friends and allies of our reverend father in God, Aymer, Prior of
      Jorvaulx,&rdquo; said the monk, without noticing the tone of De Bracy's reply;
      &ldquo;ye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for what saith
      the blessed Saint Augustin, in his treatise 'De Civitate Dei'&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What saith the devil!&rdquo; interrupted Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;or rather what dost
      thou say, Sir Priest? We have little time to hear texts from the holy
      fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sancta Maria!'&rdquo; ejaculated Father Ambrose, &ldquo;how prompt to ire are these
      unhallowed laymen!&mdash;But be it known to you, brave knights, that
      certain murderous caitiffs, casting behind them fear of God, and reverence
      of his church, and not regarding the bull of the holy see, 'Si quis,
      suadende Diabolo'&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother priest,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;all this we know or guess at&mdash;tell
      us plainly, is thy master, the Prior, made prisoner, and to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Ambrose, &ldquo;he is in the hands of the men of Belial,
      infesters of these woods, and contemners of the holy text, 'Touch not mine
      anointed, and do my prophets naught of evil.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a new argument for our swords, sirs,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf,
      turning to his companions; &ldquo;and so, instead of reaching us any assistance,
      the Prior of Jorvaulx requests aid at our hands? a man is well helped of
      these lazy churchmen when he hath most to do!&mdash;But speak out, priest,
      and say at once, what doth thy master expect from us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So please you,&rdquo; said Ambrose, &ldquo;violent hands having been imposed on my
      reverend superior, contrary to the holy ordinance which I did already
      quote, and the men of Belial having rifled his mails and budgets, and
      stripped him of two hundred marks of pure refined gold, they do yet demand
      of him a large sum beside, ere they will suffer him to depart from their
      uncircumcised hands. Wherefore the reverend father in God prays you, as
      his dear friends, to rescue him, either by paying down the ransom at which
      they hold him, or by force of arms, at your best discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foul fiend quell the Prior!&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;his morning's
      drought has been a deep one. When did thy master hear of a Norman baron
      unbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman, whose bags are ten times as
      weighty as ours?&mdash;And how can we do aught by valour to free him, that
      are cooped up here by ten times our number, and expect an assault every
      moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was what I was about to tell you,&rdquo; said the monk, &ldquo;had your
      hastiness allowed me time. But, God help me, I am old, and these foul
      onslaughts distract an aged man's brain. Nevertheless, it is of verity
      that they assemble a camp, and raise a bank against the walls of this
      castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the battlements!&rdquo; cried De Bracy, &ldquo;and let us mark what these knaves
      do without;&rdquo; and so saying, he opened a latticed window which led to a
      sort of bartisan or projecting balcony, and immediately called from thence
      to those in the apartment&mdash;&ldquo;Saint Dennis, but the old monk hath
      brought true tidings!&mdash;They bring forward mantelets and pavisses, <a
      href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32" id="linknoteref-32"><small>32</small></a>
      and the archers muster on the skirts of the wood like a dark cloud before
      a hailstorm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reginald Front-de-Boeuf also looked out upon the field, and immediately
      snatched his bugle; and, after winding a long and loud blast, commanded
      his men to their posts on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Bracy, look to the eastern side, where the walls are lowest&mdash;Noble
      Bois-Guilbert, thy trade hath well taught thee how to attack and defend,
      look thou to the western side&mdash;I myself will take post at the
      barbican. Yet, do not confine your exertions to any one spot, noble
      friends!&mdash;we must this day be everywhere, and multiply ourselves,
      were it possible, so as to carry by our presence succour and relief
      wherever the attack is hottest. Our numbers are few, but activity and
      courage may supply that defect, since we have only to do with rascal
      clowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, noble knights,&rdquo; exclaimed Father Ambrose, amidst the bustle and
      confusion occasioned by the preparations for defence, &ldquo;will none of ye
      hear the message of the reverend father in God Aymer, Prior of Jorvaulx?&mdash;I
      beseech thee to hear me, noble Sir Reginald!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go patter thy petitions to heaven,&rdquo; said the fierce Norman, &ldquo;for we on
      earth have no time to listen to them.&mdash;Ho! there, Anselm I see that
      seething pitch and oil are ready to pour on the heads of these audacious
      traitors&mdash;Look that the cross-bowmen lack not bolts. <a
      href="#linknote-33" name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33"><small>33</small></a>&mdash;Fling
      abroad my banner with the old bull's head&mdash;the knaves shall soon find
      with whom they have to do this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, noble sir,&rdquo; continued the monk, persevering in his endeavours to
      draw attention, &ldquo;consider my vow of obedience, and let me discharge myself
      of my Superior's errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away with this prating dotard,&rdquo; said Front-de Boeuf, &ldquo;lock him up in the
      chapel, to tell his beads till the broil be over. It will be a new thing
      to the saints in Torquilstone to hear aves and paters; they have not been
      so honoured, I trow, since they were cut out of stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaspheme not the holy saints, Sir Reginald,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;we shall
      have need of their aid to-day before yon rascal rout disband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect little aid from their hand,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;unless we
      were to hurl them from the battlements on the heads of the villains. There
      is a huge lumbering Saint Christopher yonder, sufficient to bear a whole
      company to the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Templar had in the meantime been looking out on the proceedings of the
      besiegers, with rather more attention than the brutal Front-de-Boeuf or
      his giddy companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the faith of mine order,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these men approach with more touch
      of discipline than could have been judged, however they come by it. See ye
      how dexterously they avail themselves of every cover which a tree or bush
      affords, and shun exposing themselves to the shot of our cross-bows? I spy
      neither banner nor pennon among them, and yet will I gage my golden chain,
      that they are led on by some noble knight or gentleman, skilful in the
      practice of wars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I espy him,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I see the waving of a knight's crest, and
      the gleam of his armour. See yon tall man in the black mail, who is busied
      marshalling the farther troop of the rascaille yeomen&mdash;by Saint
      Dennis, I hold him to be the same whom we called 'Le Noir Faineant', who
      overthrew thee, Front-de-Boeuf, in the lists at Ashby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;that he comes here to give me
      my revenge. Some hilding fellow he must be, who dared not stay to assert
      his claim to the tourney prize which chance had assigned him. I should in
      vain have sought for him where knights and nobles seek their foes, and
      right glad am I he hath here shown himself among yon villain yeomanry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The demonstrations of the enemy's immediate approach cut off all farther
      discourse. Each knight repaired to his post, and at the head of the few
      followers whom they were able to muster, and who were in numbers
      inadequate to defend the whole extent of the walls, they awaited with calm
      determination the threatened assault.

     &mdash;The Jew
</pre>
    <p>
      Our history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to inform
      the reader of certain passages material to his understanding the rest of
      this important narrative. His own intelligence may indeed have easily
      anticipated that, when Ivanhoe sunk down, and seemed abandoned by all the
      world, it was the importunity of Rebecca which prevailed on her father to
      have the gallant young warrior transported from the lists to the house
      which for the time the Jews inhabited in the suburbs of Ashby.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not have been difficult to have persuaded Isaac to this step in
      any other circumstances, for his disposition was kind and grateful. But he
      had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted people,
      and those were to be conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Abraham!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;he is a good youth, and my heart bleeds to
      see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton, and his corslet
      of goodly price&mdash;but to carry him to our house!&mdash;damsel, hast
      thou well considered?&mdash;he is a Christian, and by our law we may not
      deal with the stranger and Gentile, save for the advantage of our
      commerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak not so, my dear father,&rdquo; replied Rebecca; &ldquo;we may not indeed mix
      with them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and in misery, the
      Gentile becometh the Jew's brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would I knew what the Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it,&rdquo;
       replied Isaac;&mdash;&ldquo;nevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to
      death. Let Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, let them place him in my litter,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;I will mount one of
      the palfreys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of Ishmael and of
      Edom,&rdquo; whispered Isaac, with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of
      knights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her
      charitable purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until Isaac,
      seizing the sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried voice&mdash;&ldquo;Beard
      of Aaron!&mdash;what if the youth perish!&mdash;if he die in our custody,
      shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces by the
      multitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not die, my father,&rdquo; said Rebecca, gently extricating herself
      from the grasp of Isaac &ldquo;he will not die unless we abandon him; and if so,
      we are indeed answerable for his blood to God and to man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Isaac, releasing his hold, &ldquo;it grieveth me as much to see the
      drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzants from mine own
      purse; and I well know, that the lessons of Miriam, daughter of the Rabbi
      Manasses of Byzantium whose soul is in Paradise, have made thee skilful in
      the art of healing, and that thou knowest the craft of herbs, and the
      force of elixirs. Therefore, do as thy mind giveth thee&mdash;thou art a
      good damsel, a blessing, and a crown, and a song of rejoicing unto me and
      unto my house, and unto the people of my fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apprehensions of Isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the
      generous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her
      return to Ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The
      Templar twice passed and repassed them on the road, fixing his bold and
      ardent look on the beautiful Jewess; and we have already seen the
      consequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident
      threw her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their
      temporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands to examine and to
      bind up his wounds. The youngest reader of romances and romantic ballads,
      must recollect how often the females, during the dark ages, as they are
      called, were initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how frequently
      the gallant knight submitted the wounds of his person to her cure, whose
      eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Jews, both male and female, possessed and practised the medical
      science in all its branches, and the monarchs and powerful barons of the
      time frequently committed themselves to the charge of some experienced
      sage among this despised people, when wounded or in sickness. The aid of
      the Jewish physicians was not the less eagerly sought after, though a
      general belief prevailed among the Christians, that the Jewish Rabbins
      were deeply acquainted with the occult sciences, and particularly with the
      cabalistical art, which had its name and origin in the studies of the
      sages of Israel. Neither did the Rabbins disown such acquaintance with
      supernatural arts, which added nothing (for what could add aught?) to the
      hatred with which their nation was regarded, while it diminished the
      contempt with which that malevolence was mingled. A Jewish magician might
      be the subject of equal abhorrence with a Jewish usurer, but he could not
      be equally despised. It is besides probable, considering the wonderful
      cures they are said to have performed, that the Jews possessed some
      secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with the
      exclusive spirit arising out of their condition, they took great care to
      conceal from the Christians amongst whom they dwelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful Rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge
      proper to her nation, which her apt and powerful mind had retained,
      arranged, and enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond her years, her
      sex, and even the age in which she lived. Her knowledge of medicine and of
      the healing art had been acquired under an aged Jewess, the daughter of
      one of their most celebrated doctors, who loved Rebecca as her own child,
      and was believed to have communicated to her secrets, which had been left
      to herself by her sage father at the same time, and under the same
      circumstances. The fate of Miriam had indeed been to fall a sacrifice to
      the fanaticism of the times; but her secrets had survived in her apt
      pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally
      revered and admired by her own tribe, who almost regarded her as one of
      those gifted women mentioned in the sacred history. Her father himself,
      out of reverence for her talents, which involuntarily mingled itself with
      his unbounded affection, permitted the maiden a greater liberty than was
      usually indulged to those of her sex by the habits of her people, and was,
      as we have just seen, frequently guided by her opinion, even in preference
      to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ivanhoe reached the habitation of Isaac, he was still in a state of
      unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken place
      during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound, and having
      applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed, informed her
      father that if fever could be averted, of which the great bleeding
      rendered her little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of Miriam
      retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guest's life, and
      that he might with safety travel to York with them on the ensuing day.
      Isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. His charity would
      willingly have stopped short at Ashby, or at most would have left the
      wounded Christian to be tended in the house where he was residing at
      present, with an assurance to the Hebrew to whom it belonged, that all
      expenses should be duly discharged. To this, however, Rebecca opposed many
      reasons, of which we shall only mention two that had peculiar weight with
      Isaac. The one was, that she would on no account put the phial of precious
      balsam into the hands of another physician even of her own tribe, lest
      that valuable mystery should be discovered; the other, that this wounded
      knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, was an intimate favourite of Richard
      Coeur-de-Lion, and that, in case the monarch should return, Isaac, who had
      supplied his brother John with treasure to prosecute his rebellious
      purposes, would stand in no small need of a powerful protector who enjoyed
      Richard's favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art speaking but sooth, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Isaac, giving way to these
      weighty arguments&mdash;&ldquo;it were an offending of Heaven to betray the
      secrets of the blessed Miriam; for the good which Heaven giveth, is not
      rashly to be squandered upon others, whether it be talents of gold and
      shekels of silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise
      physician&mdash;assuredly they should be preserved to those to whom
      Providence hath vouchsafed them. And him whom the Nazarenes of England
      call the Lion's Heart, assuredly it were better for me to fall into the
      hands of a strong lion of Idumea than into his, if he shall have got
      assurance of my dealing with his brother. Wherefore I will lend ear to thy
      counsel, and this youth shall journey with us unto York, and our house
      shall be as a home to him until his wounds shall be healed. And if he of
      the Lion Heart shall return to the land, as is now noised abroad, then
      shall this Wilfred of Ivanhoe be unto me as a wall of defence, when the
      king's displeasure shall burn high against thy father. And if he doth not
      return, this Wilfred may natheless repay us our charges when he shall gain
      treasure by the strength of his spear and of his sword, even as he did
      yesterday and this day also. For the youth is a good youth, and keepeth
      the day which he appointeth, and restoreth that which he borroweth, and
      succoureth the Israelite, even the child of my father's house, when he is
      encompassed by strong thieves and sons of Belial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored to
      consciousness of his situation. He awoke from a broken slumber, under the
      confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery from a
      state of insensibility. He was unable for some time to recall exactly to
      memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the lists, or to
      make out any connected chain of the events in which he had been engaged
      upon the yesterday. A sense of wounds and injury, joined to great weakness
      and exhaustion, was mingled with the recollection of blows dealt and
      received, of steeds rushing upon each other, overthrowing and overthrown&mdash;of
      shouts and clashing of arms, and all the heady tumult of a confused fight.
      An effort to draw aside the curtain of his couch was in some degree
      successful, although rendered difficult by the pain of his wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great surprise he found himself in a room magnificently furnished,
      but having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon, and in other respects
      partaking so much of Oriental costume, that he began to doubt whether he
      had not, during his sleep, been transported back again to the land of
      Palestine. The impression was increased, when, the tapestry being drawn
      aside, a female form, dressed in a rich habit, which partook more of the
      Eastern taste than that of Europe, glided through the door which it
      concealed, and was followed by a swarthy domestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition, she
      imposed silence by placing her slender finger upon her ruby lips, while
      the attendant, approaching him, proceeded to uncover Ivanhoe's side, and
      the lovely Jewess satisfied herself that the bandage was in its place, and
      the wound doing well. She performed her task with a graceful and dignified
      simplicity and modesty, which might, even in more civilized days, have
      served to redeem it from whatever might seem repugnant to female delicacy.
      The idea of so young and beautiful a person engaged in attendance on a
      sick-bed, or in dressing the wound of one of a different sex, was melted
      away and lost in that of a beneficent being contributing her effectual aid
      to relieve pain, and to avert the stroke of death. Rebecca's few and brief
      directions were given in the Hebrew language to the old domestic; and he,
      who had been frequently her assistant in similar cases, obeyed them
      without reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded
      when uttered by another, had, coming from the beautiful Rebecca, the
      romantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms pronounced
      by some beneficent fairy, unintelligible, indeed, to the ear, but, from
      the sweetness of utterance, and benignity of aspect, which accompanied
      them, touching and affecting to the heart. Without making an attempt at
      further question, Ivanhoe suffered them in silence to take the measures
      they thought most proper for his recovery; and it was not until those were
      completed, and this kind physician about to retire, that his curiosity
      could no longer be suppressed.&mdash;&ldquo;Gentle maiden,&rdquo; he began in the
      Arabian tongue, with which his Eastern travels had rendered him familiar,
      and which he thought most likely to be understood by the turban'd and
      caftan'd damsel who stood before him&mdash;&ldquo;I pray you, gentle maiden, of
      your courtesy&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she could
      scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whose general expression
      was that of contemplative melancholy. &ldquo;I am of England, Sir Knight, and
      speak the English tongue, although my dress and my lineage belong to
      another climate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble damsel,&rdquo;&mdash;again the Knight of Ivanhoe began; and again Rebecca
      hastened to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bestow not on me, Sir Knight,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the epithet of noble. It is
      well you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor Jewess, the
      daughter of that Isaac of York, to whom you were so lately a good and kind
      lord. It well becomes him, and those of his household, to render to you
      such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I know not whether the fair Rowena would have been altogether satisfied
      with the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto
      gazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of the
      lovely Rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were,
      mellowed, by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes, and which a minstrel
      would have compared to the evening star darting its rays through a bower
      of jessamine. But Ivanhoe was too good a Catholic to retain the same class
      of feelings towards a Jewess. This Rebecca had foreseen, and for this very
      purpose she had hastened to mention her father's name and lineage; yet&mdash;for
      the fair and wise daughter of Isaac was not without a touch of female
      weakness&mdash;she could not but sigh internally when the glance of
      respectful admiration, not altogether unmixed with tenderness, with which
      Ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his unknown benefactress, was exchanged at
      once for a manner cold, composed, and collected, and fraught with no
      deeper feeling than that which expressed a grateful sense of courtesy
      received from an unexpected quarter, and from one of an inferior race. It
      was not that Ivanhoe's former carriage expressed more than that general
      devotional homage which youth always pays to beauty; yet it was mortifying
      that one word should operate as a spell to remove poor Rebecca, who could
      not be supposed altogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into a
      degraded class, to whom it could not be honourably rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gentleness and candour of Rebecca's nature imputed no fault to
      Ivanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and religion.
      On the contrary the fair Jewess, though sensible her patient now regarded
      her as one of a race of reprobation, with whom it was disgraceful to hold
      any beyond the most necessary intercourse, ceased not to pay the same
      patient and devoted attention to his safety and convalescence. She
      informed him of the necessity they were under of removing to York, and of
      her father's resolution to transport him thither, and tend him in his own
      house until his health should be restored. Ivanhoe expressed great
      repugnance to this plan, which he grounded on unwillingness to give
      farther trouble to his benefactors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in Ashby, or near it, some Saxon franklin, or
      even some wealthy peasant, who would endure the burden of a wounded
      countryman's residence with him until he should be again able to bear his
      armour?&mdash;Was there no convent of Saxon endowment, where he could be
      received?&mdash;Or could he not be transported as far as Burton, where he
      was sure to find hospitality with Waltheoff, the Abbot of St Withold's, to
      whom he was related?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any, the worst of these harbourages,&rdquo; said Rebecca, with a melancholy
      smile, &ldquo;would unquestionably be more fitting for your residence than the
      abode of a despised Jew; yet, Sir Knight, unless you would dismiss your
      physician, you cannot change your lodging. Our nation, as you well know,
      can cure wounds, though we deal not in inflicting them; and in our own
      family, in particular, are secrets which have been handed down since the
      days of Solomon, and of which you have already experienced the advantages.
      No Nazarene&mdash;I crave your forgiveness, Sir Knight&mdash;no Christian
      leech, within the four seas of Britain, could enable you to bear your
      corslet within a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how soon wilt THOU enable me to brook it?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my
      directions,&rdquo; replied Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Our Blessed Lady,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;if it be not a sin to name her here,
      it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; and if thou
      accomplish thy promise, maiden, I will pay thee with my casque full of
      crowns, come by them as I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accomplish my promise,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;and thou shalt bear thine
      armour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grant me but one boon in
      the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be within my power, and such as a true Christian knight may yield
      to one of thy people,&rdquo; replied Ivanhoe, &ldquo;I will grant thy boon blithely
      and thankfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;I will but pray of thee to believe henceforward
      that a Jew may do good service to a Christian, without desiring other
      guerdon than the blessing of the Great Father who made both Jew and
      Gentile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were sin to doubt it, maiden,&rdquo; replied Ivanhoe; &ldquo;and I repose myself
      on thy skill without further scruple or question, well trusting you will
      enable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day. And now, my kind leech,
      let me enquire of the news abroad. What of the noble Saxon Cedric and his
      household?&mdash;what of the lovely Lady&mdash;&rdquo; He stopt, as if unwilling
      to speak Rowena's name in the house of a Jew&mdash;&ldquo;Of her, I mean, who
      was named Queen of the tournament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was selected by you, Sir Knight, to hold that dignity, with
      judgment which was admired as much as your valour,&rdquo; replied Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood which Ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing his
      cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in Rowena
      by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was less of her I would speak,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;than of Prince John; and I
      would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why he now attends me
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me use my authority as a leech,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;and enjoin you to
      keep silence, and avoid agitating reflections, whilst I apprize you of
      what you desire to know. Prince John hath broken off the tournament, and
      set forward in all haste towards York, with the nobles, knights, and
      churchmen of his party, after collecting such sums as they could wring, by
      fair means or foul, from those who are esteemed the wealthy of the land.
      It is said he designs to assume his brother's crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without a blow struck in its defence,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, raising himself
      upon the couch, &ldquo;if there were but one true subject in England I will
      fight for Richard's title with the best of them&mdash;ay, one or two, in
      his just quarrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that you may be able to do so,&rdquo; said Rebecca touching his shoulder
      with her hand, &ldquo;you must now observe my directions, and remain quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, maiden,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;as quiet as these disquieted times will
      permit&mdash;And of Cedric and his household?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His steward came but brief while since,&rdquo; said the Jewess, &ldquo;panting with
      haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the growth
      of Cedric's flocks, and from him I learned that Cedric and Athelstane of
      Coningsburgh had left Prince John's lodging in high displeasure, and were
      about to set forth on their return homeward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went any lady with them to the banquet?&rdquo; said Wilfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady Rowena,&rdquo; said Rebecca, answering the question with more
      precision than it had been asked&mdash;&ldquo;The Lady Rowena went not to the
      Prince's feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her
      journey back to Rotherwood, with her guardian Cedric. And touching your
      faithful squire Gurth&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight, &ldquo;knowest thou his name?&mdash;But thou dost,&rdquo;
       he immediately added, &ldquo;and well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and,
      as I am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he
      received but yesterday a hundred zecchins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak not of that,&rdquo; said Rebecca, blushing deeply; &ldquo;I see how easy it is
      for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this sum of gold,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, gravely, &ldquo;my honour is concerned in
      repaying it to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be as thou wilt,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;when eight days have passed away;
      but think not, and speak not now, of aught that may retard thy recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, kind maiden,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;I were most ungrateful to dispute
      thy commands. But one word of the fate of poor Gurth, and I have done with
      questioning thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grieve to tell thee, Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered the Jewess, &ldquo;that he is in
      custody by the order of Cedric.&rdquo;&mdash;And then observing the distress
      which her communication gave to Wilfred, she instantly added, &ldquo;But the
      steward Oswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew his master's
      displeasure against him, he was sure that Cedric would pardon Gurth, a
      faithful serf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had but committed
      this error out of the love which he bore to Cedric's son. And he said,
      moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially Wamba the Jester, were
      resolved to warn Gurth to make his escape by the way, in case Cedric's ire
      against him could not be mitigated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God they may keep their purpose!&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;but it seems as
      if I were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath shown kindness to me.
      My king, by whom I was honoured and distinguished, thou seest that the
      brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his crown;&mdash;my
      regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of her sex;&mdash;and
      now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman but for his love and
      loyal service to me!&mdash;Thou seest, maiden, what an ill-fated wretch
      thou dost labour to assist; be wise, and let me go, ere the misfortunes
      which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall involve thee also in
      their pursuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;thy weakness and thy grief, Sir Knight, make thee
      miscalculate the purposes of Heaven. Thou hast been restored to thy
      country when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true
      heart, and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of thy
      king, when their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil which thou
      hast sustained, seest thou not that Heaven has raised thee a helper and a
      physician, even among the most despised of the land?&mdash;Therefore, be
      of good courage, and trust that thou art preserved for some marvel which
      thine arm shall work before this people. Adieu&mdash;and having taken the
      medicine which I shall send thee by the hand of Reuben, compose thyself
      again to rest, that thou mayest be the more able to endure the journey on
      the succeeding day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of
      Rebecca. The drought which Reuben administered was of a sedative and
      narcotic quality, and secured the patient sound and undisturbed slumbers.
      In the morning his kind physician found him entirely free from feverish
      symptoms, and fit to undergo the fatigue of a journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the lists,
      and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. In one
      circumstance only even the entreaties of Rebecca were unable to secure
      sufficient attention to the accommodation of the wounded knight. Isaac,
      like the enriched traveller of Juvenal's tenth satire, had ever the fear
      of robbery before his eyes, conscious that he would be alike accounted
      fair game by the marauding Norman noble, and by the Saxon outlaw. He
      therefore journeyed at a great rate, and made short halts, and shorter
      repasts, so that he passed by Cedric and Athelstane who had several hours
      the start of him, but who had been delayed by their protracted feasting at
      the convent of Saint Withold's. Yet such was the virtue of Miriam's
      balsam, or such the strength of Ivanhoe's constitution, that he did not
      sustain from the hurried journey that inconvenience which his kind
      physician had apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another point of view, however, the Jew's haste proved somewhat more
      than good speed. The rapidity with which he insisted on travelling, bred
      several disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to attend him
      as a guard. These men were Saxons, and not free by any means from the
      national love of ease and good living which the Normans stigmatized as
      laziness and gluttony. Reversing Shylock's position, they had accepted the
      employment in hopes of feeding upon the wealthy Jew, and were very much
      displeased when they found themselves disappointed, by the rapidity with
      which he insisted on their proceeding. They remonstrated also upon the
      risk of damage to their horses by these forced marches. Finally, there
      arose betwixt Isaac and his satellites a deadly feud, concerning the
      quantity of wine and ale to be allowed for consumption at each meal. And
      thus it happened, that when the alarm of danger approached, and that which
      Isaac feared was likely to come upon him, he was deserted by the
      discontented mercenaries on whose protection he had relied, without using
      the means necessary to secure their attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this deplorable condition the Jew, with his daughter and her wounded
      patient, were found by Cedric, as has already been noticed, and soon
      afterwards fell into the power of De Bracy and his confederates. Little
      notice was at first taken of the horse-litter, and it might have remained
      behind but for the curiosity of De Bracy, who looked into it under the
      impression that it might contain the object of his enterprise, for Rowena
      had not unveiled herself. But De Bracy's astonishment was considerable,
      when he discovered that the litter contained a wounded man, who,
      conceiving himself to have fallen into the power of Saxon outlaws, with
      whom his name might be a protection for himself and his friends, frankly
      avowed himself to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity,
      never utterly abandoned De Bracy, prohibited him from doing the knight any
      injury in his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his betraying
      him to Front-de-Boeuf, who would have had no scruples to put to death,
      under any circumstances, the rival claimant of the fief of Ivanhoe. On the
      other hand, to liberate a suitor preferred by the Lady Rowena, as the
      events of the tournament, and indeed Wilfred's previous banishment from
      his father's house, had made matter of notoriety, was a pitch far above
      the flight of De Bracy's generosity. A middle course betwixt good and evil
      was all which he found himself capable of adopting, and he commanded two
      of his own squires to keep close by the litter, and to suffer no one to
      approach it. If questioned, they were directed by their master to say,
      that the empty litter of the Lady Rowena was employed to transport one of
      their comrades who had been wounded in the scuffle. On arriving at
      Torquilstone, while the Knight Templar and the lord of that castle were
      each intent upon their own schemes, the one on the Jew's treasure, and the
      other on his daughter, De Bracy's squires conveyed Ivanhoe, still under
      the name of a wounded comrade, to a distant apartment. This explanation
      was accordingly returned by these men to Front-de-Boeuf, when he
      questioned them why they did not make for the battlements upon the alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wounded companion!&rdquo; he replied in great wrath and astonishment. &ldquo;No
      wonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous as even to lay leaguer
      before castles, and that clowns and swineherds send defiances to nobles,
      since men-at-arms have turned sick men's nurses, and Free Companions are
      grown keepers of dying folk's curtains, when the castle is about to be
      assailed.&mdash;To the battlements, ye loitering villains!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      raising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung again, &ldquo;to the
      battlements, or I will splinter your bones with this truncheon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men sulkily replied, &ldquo;that they desired nothing better than to go to
      the battlements, providing Front-de-Boeuf would bear them out with their
      master, who had commanded them to tend the dying man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dying man, knaves!&rdquo; rejoined the Baron; &ldquo;I promise thee we shall all
      be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly. But I will relieve
      the guard upon this caitiff companion of yours.&mdash;Here, Urfried&mdash;hag&mdash;fiend
      of a Saxon witch&mdash;hearest me not?&mdash;tend me this bedridden fellow
      since he must needs be tended, whilst these knaves use their weapons.&mdash;Here
      be two arblasts, comrades, with windlaces and quarrells <a
      href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34"><small>34</small></a>&mdash;to
      the barbican with you, and see you drive each bolt through a Saxon brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise and
      detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were
      commanded, and thus the charge of Ivanhoe was transferred to Urfried, or
      Ulrica. But she, whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries and
      with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon Rebecca the
      care of her patient.

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ascend the watch-tower yonder, valiant soldier,
     Look on the field, and say how goes the battle.
     &mdash;Schiller's Maid of Orleans
</pre>
    <p>
      A moment of peril is often also a moment of open-hearted kindness and
      affection. We are thrown off our guard by the general agitation of our
      feelings, and betray the intensity of those, which, at more tranquil
      periods, our prudence at least conceals, if it cannot altogether suppress
      them. In finding herself once more by the side of Ivanhoe, Rebecca was
      astonished at the keen sensation of pleasure which she experienced, even
      at a time when all around them both was danger, if not despair. As she
      felt his pulse, and enquired after his health, there was a softness in her
      touch and in her accents implying a kinder interest than she would herself
      have been pleased to have voluntarily expressed. Her voice faltered and
      her hand trembled, and it was only the cold question of Ivanhoe, &ldquo;Is it
      you, gentle maiden?&rdquo; which recalled her to herself, and reminded her the
      sensations which she felt were not and could not be mutual. A sigh
      escaped, but it was scarce audible; and the questions which she asked the
      knight concerning his state of health were put in the tone of calm
      friendship. Ivanhoe answered her hastily that he was, in point of health,
      as well, and better than he could have expected&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;dear Rebecca, to thy helpful skill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He calls me DEAR Rebecca,&rdquo; said the maiden to herself, &ldquo;but it is in the
      cold and careless tone which ill suits the word. His war-horse&mdash;his
      hunting hound, are dearer to him than the despised Jewess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind, gentle maiden,&rdquo; continued Ivanhoe, &ldquo;is more disturbed by
      anxiety, than my body with pain. From the speeches of those men who were
      my warders just now, I learn that I am a prisoner, and, if I judge aright
      of the loud hoarse voice which even now dispatched them hence on some
      military duty, I am in the castle of Front-de-Boeuf&mdash;If so, how will
      this end, or how can I protect Rowena and my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He names not the Jew or Jewess,&rdquo; said Rebecca internally; &ldquo;yet what is
      our portion in him, and how justly am I punished by Heaven for letting my
      thoughts dwell upon him!&rdquo; She hastened after this brief self-accusation to
      give Ivanhoe what information she could; but it amounted only to this,
      that the Templar Bois-Guilbert, and the Baron Front-de-Boeuf, were
      commanders within the castle; that it was beleaguered from without, but by
      whom she knew not. She added, that there was a Christian priest within the
      castle who might be possessed of more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Christian priest!&rdquo; said the knight, joyfully; &ldquo;fetch him hither,
      Rebecca, if thou canst&mdash;say a sick man desires his ghostly counsel&mdash;say
      what thou wilt, but bring him&mdash;something I must do or attempt, but
      how can I determine until I know how matters stand without?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca in compliance with the wishes of Ivanhoe, made that attempt to
      bring Cedric into the wounded Knight's chamber, which was defeated as we
      have already seen by the interference of Urfried, who had also been on the
      watch to intercept the supposed monk. Rebecca retired to communicate to
      Ivanhoe the result of her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of
      intelligence, or to contrive by what means it might be supplied; for the
      noise within the castle, occasioned by the defensive preparations which
      had been considerable for some time, now increased into tenfold bustle and
      clamour. The heavy, yet hasty step of the men-at-arms, traversed the
      battlements or resounded on the narrow and winding passages and stairs
      which led to the various bartisans and points of defence. The voices of
      the knights were heard, animating their followers, or directing means of
      defence, while their commands were often drowned in the clashing of
      armour, or the clamorous shouts of those whom they addressed. Tremendous
      as these sounds were, and yet more terrible from the awful event which
      they presaged, there was a sublimity mixed with them, which Rebecca's
      high-toned mind could feel even in that moment of terror. Her eye kindled,
      although the blood fled from her cheeks; and there was a strong mixture of
      fear, and of a thrilling sense of the sublime, as she repeated, half
      whispering to herself, half speaking to her companion, the sacred text,&mdash;&ldquo;The
      quiver rattleth&mdash;the glittering spear and the shield&mdash;the noise
      of the captains and the shouting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage, glowing with
      impatience at his inactivity, and with his ardent desire to mingle in the
      affray of which these sounds were the introduction. &ldquo;If I could but drag
      myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to yonder window, that I might see how this brave game
      is like to go&mdash;If I had but bow to shoot a shaft, or battle-axe to
      strike were it but a single blow for our deliverance!&mdash;It is in vain&mdash;it
      is in vain&mdash;I am alike nerveless and weaponless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fret not thyself, noble knight,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;the sounds have
      ceased of a sudden&mdash;it may be they join not battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou knowest nought of it,&rdquo; said Wilfred, impatiently; &ldquo;this dead pause
      only shows that the men are at their posts on the walls, and expecting an
      instant attack; what we have heard was but the instant muttering of the
      storm&mdash;it will burst anon in all its fury.&mdash;Could I but reach
      yonder window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,&rdquo; replied his
      attendant. Observing his extreme solicitude, she firmly added, &ldquo;I myself
      will stand at the lattice, and describe to you as I can what passes
      without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not&mdash;you shall not!&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe; &ldquo;each lattice, each
      aperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some random shaft&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be welcome!&rdquo; murmured Rebecca, as with firm pace she ascended
      two or three steps, which led to the window of which they spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca, dear Rebecca!&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe, &ldquo;this is no maiden's pastime&mdash;do
      not expose thyself to wounds and death, and render me for ever miserable
      for having given the occasion; at least, cover thyself with yonder ancient
      buckler, and show as little of your person at the lattice as may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe, and
      availing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield, which she
      placed against the lower part of the window, Rebecca, with tolerable
      security to herself, could witness part of what was passing without the
      castle, and report to Ivanhoe the preparations which the assailants were
      making for the storm. Indeed the situation which she thus obtained was
      peculiarly favourable for this purpose, because, being placed on an angle
      of the main building, Rebecca could not only see what passed beyond the
      precincts of the castle, but also commanded a view of the outwork likely
      to be the first object of the meditated assault. It was an exterior
      fortification of no great height or strength, intended to protect the
      postern-gate, through which Cedric had been recently dismissed by
      Front-de-Boeuf. The castle moat divided this species of barbican from the
      rest of the fortress, so that, in case of its being taken, it was easy to
      cut off the communication with the main building, by withdrawing the
      temporary bridge. In the outwork was a sallyport corresponding to the
      postern of the castle, and the whole was surrounded by a strong palisade.
      Rebecca could observe, from the number of men placed for the defence of
      this post, that the besieged entertained apprehensions for its safety; and
      from the mustering of the assailants in a direction nearly opposite to the
      outwork, it seemed no less plain that it had been selected as a vulnerable
      point of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      These appearances she hastily communicated to Ivanhoe, and added, &ldquo;The
      skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are
      advanced from its dark shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under what banner?&rdquo; asked Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under no ensign of war which I can observe,&rdquo; answered Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A singular novelty,&rdquo; muttered the knight, &ldquo;to advance to storm such a
      castle without pennon or banner displayed!&mdash;Seest thou who they be
      that act as leaders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A knight, clad in sable armour, is the most conspicuous,&rdquo; said the
      Jewess; &ldquo;he alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the
      direction of all around him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What device does he bear on his shield?&rdquo; replied Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue on the
      black shield.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35"       id="linknoteref-35"><small>35</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fetterlock and shacklebolt azure,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;I know not who may
      bear the device, but well I ween it might now be mine own. Canst thou not
      see the motto?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarce the device itself at this distance,&rdquo; replied Rebecca; &ldquo;but when
      the sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seem there no other leaders?&rdquo; exclaimed the anxious enquirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station,&rdquo; said
      Rebecca; &ldquo;but, doubtless, the other side of the castle is also assailed.
      They appear even now preparing to advance&mdash;God of Zion, protect us!&mdash;What
      a dreadful sight!&mdash;Those who advance first bear huge shields and
      defences made of plank; the others follow, bending their bows as they come
      on.&mdash;They raise their bows!&mdash;God of Moses, forgive the creatures
      thou hast made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault,
      which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once answered by a
      flourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements, which, mingled with
      the deep and hollow clang of the nakers, (a species of kettle-drum,)
      retorted in notes of defiance the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of
      both parties augmented the fearful din, the assailants crying, &ldquo;Saint
      George for merry England!&rdquo; and the Normans answering them with loud cries
      of &ldquo;En avant De Bracy!&mdash;Beau-seant! Beau-seant!&mdash;Front-de-Boeuf
      a la rescousse!&rdquo; according to the war-cries of their different commanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, however, by clamour that the contest was to be decided, and
      the desperate efforts of the assailants were met by an equally vigorous
      defence on the part of the besieged. The archers, trained by their
      woodland pastimes to the most effective use of the long-bow, shot, to use
      the appropriate phrase of the time, so &ldquo;wholly together,&rdquo; that no point at
      which a defender could show the least part of his person, escaped their
      cloth-yard shafts. By this heavy discharge, which continued as thick and
      sharp as hail, while, notwithstanding, every arrow had its individual aim,
      and flew by scores together against each embrasure and opening in the
      parapets, as well as at every window where a defender either occasionally
      had post, or might be suspected to be stationed,&mdash;by this sustained
      discharge, two or three of the garrison were slain, and several others
      wounded. But, confident in their armour of proof, and in the cover which
      their situation afforded, the followers of Front-de-Boeuf, and his allies,
      showed an obstinacy in defence proportioned to the fury of the attack and
      replied with the discharge of their large cross-bows, as well as with
      their long-bows, slings, and other missile weapons, to the close and
      continued shower of arrows; and, as the assailants were necessarily but
      indifferently protected, did considerably more damage than they received
      at their hand. The whizzing of shafts and of missiles, on both sides, was
      only interrupted by the shouts which arose when either side inflicted or
      sustained some notable loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I must lie here like a bedridden monk,&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe, &ldquo;while the
      game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of others!&mdash;Look
      from the window once again, kind maiden, but beware that you are not
      marked by the archers beneath&mdash;Look out once more, and tell me if
      they yet advance to the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she had employed
      in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the lattice, sheltering
      herself, however, so as not to be visible from beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dost thou see, Rebecca?&rdquo; again demanded the wounded knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes,
      and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That cannot endure,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;if they press not right on to carry
      the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail but little against
      stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the Knight of the Fetterlock, fair
      Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as the leader is, so will his
      followers be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see him not,&rdquo; said Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foul craven!&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe; &ldquo;does he blench from the helm when the
      wind blows highest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He blenches not! he blenches not!&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I see him now; he leads
      a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbican. <a
      href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36" id="linknoteref-36"><small>36</small></a>
      &mdash;They pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers
      with axes.&mdash;His high black plume floats abroad over the throng, like
      a raven over the field of the slain.&mdash;They have made a breach in the
      barriers&mdash;they rush in&mdash;they are thrust back!&mdash;Front-de-Boeuf
      heads the defenders; I see his gigantic form above the press. They throng
      again to the breach, and the pass is disputed hand to hand, and man to
      man. God of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce tides&mdash;the
      conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure a
      sight so terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look forth again, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, mistaking the cause of her
      retiring; &ldquo;the archery must in some degree have ceased, since they are now
      fighting hand to hand.&mdash;Look again, there is now less danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, &ldquo;Holy
      prophets of the law! Front-de-Boeuf and the Black Knight fight hand to
      hand on the breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the
      progress of the strife&mdash;Heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed
      and of the captive!&rdquo; She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, &ldquo;He is
      down!&mdash;he is down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is down?&rdquo; cried Ivanhoe; &ldquo;for our dear Lady's sake, tell me which has
      fallen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Black Knight,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again
      shouted with joyful eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;But no&mdash;but no!&mdash;the name
      of the Lord of Hosts be blessed!&mdash;he is on foot again, and fights as
      if there were twenty men's strength in his single arm&mdash;His sword is
      broken&mdash;he snatches an axe from a yeoman&mdash;he presses
      Front-de-Boeuf with blow on blow&mdash;The giant stoops and totters like
      an oak under the steel of the woodman&mdash;he falls&mdash;he falls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Front-de-Boeuf?&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Front-de-Boeuf!&rdquo; answered the Jewess; &ldquo;his men rush to the rescue, headed
      by the haughty Templar&mdash;their united force compels the champion to
      pause&mdash;They drag Front-de-Boeuf within the walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have&mdash;they have!&rdquo; exclaimed Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;and they press the
      besieged hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some swarm like
      bees, and endeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each other&mdash;down
      go stones, beams, and trunks of trees upon their heads, and as fast as
      they bear the wounded to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the
      assault&mdash;Great God! hast thou given men thine own image, that it
      should be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of that,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;this is no time for such thoughts&mdash;Who
      yield?&mdash;who push their way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ladders are thrown down,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, shuddering; &ldquo;the soldiers
      lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles&mdash;The besieged have
      the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint George strike for us!&rdquo; exclaimed the knight; &ldquo;do the false yeomen
      give way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Rebecca, &ldquo;they bear themselves right yeomanly&mdash;the
      Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge axe&mdash;the thundering
      blows which he deals, you may hear them above all the din and shouts of
      the battle&mdash;Stones and beams are hailed down on the bold champion&mdash;he
      regards them no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint John of Acre,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his
      couch, &ldquo;methought there was but one man in England that might do such a
      deed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The postern gate shakes,&rdquo; continued Rebecca; &ldquo;it crashes&mdash;it is
      splintered by his blows&mdash;they rush in&mdash;the outwork is won&mdash;Oh,
      God!&mdash;they hurl the defenders from the battlements&mdash;they throw
      them into the moat&mdash;O men, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can
      resist no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bridge&mdash;the bridge which communicates with the castle&mdash;have
      they won that pass?&rdquo; exclaimed Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, &ldquo;The Templar has destroyed the plank on which they
      crossed&mdash;few of the defenders escaped with him into the castle&mdash;the
      shrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the others&mdash;Alas!&mdash;I
      see it is still more difficult to look upon victory than upon battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they now, maiden?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;look forth yet again&mdash;this
      is no time to faint at bloodshed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over for the time,&rdquo; answered Rebecca; &ldquo;our friends strengthen
      themselves within the outwork which they have mastered, and it affords
      them so good a shelter from the foemen's shot, that the garrison only
      bestow a few bolts on it from interval to interval, as if rather to
      disquiet than effectually to injure them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friends,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;will surely not abandon an enterprise so
      gloriously begun and so happily attained.&mdash;O no! I will put my faith
      in the good knight whose axe hath rent heart-of-oak and bars of iron.&mdash;Singular,&rdquo;
       he again muttered to himself, &ldquo;if there be two who can do a deed of such
      derring-do! <a href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37"       id="linknoteref-37"><small>37</small></a>&mdash;a fetterlock, and a
      shacklebolt on a field sable&mdash;what may that mean?&mdash;seest thou
      nought else, Rebecca, by which the Black Knight may be distinguished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;all about him is black as the wing of the
      night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further&mdash;but having
      once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I could know him
      again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to the fray as if he were
      summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength, there seems as if
      the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every blow which
      he deals upon his enemies. God assoilize him of the sin of bloodshed!&mdash;it
      is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm and heart of one man
      can triumph over hundreds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;thou hast painted a hero; surely they rest but
      to refresh their force, or to provide the means of crossing the moat&mdash;Under
      such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be, there are no craven
      fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding up a gallant emprize; since the
      difficulties which render it arduous render it also glorious. I swear by
      the honour of my house&mdash;I vow by the name of my bright lady-love, I
      would endure ten years' captivity to fight one day by that good knight's
      side in such a quarrel as this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said Rebecca, leaving her station at the window, and approaching
      the couch of the wounded knight, &ldquo;this impatient yearning after action&mdash;this
      struggling with and repining at your present weakness, will not fail to
      injure your returning health&mdash;How couldst thou hope to inflict wounds
      on others, ere that be healed which thou thyself hast received?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;thou knowest not how impossible it is for one
      trained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest, or a woman,
      when they are acting deeds of honour around him. The love of battle is the
      food upon which we live&mdash;the dust of the 'melee' is the breath of our
      nostrils! We live not&mdash;we wish not to live&mdash;longer than while we
      are victorious and renowned&mdash;Such, maiden, are the laws of chivalry
      to which we are sworn, and to which we offer all that we hold dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the fair Jewess, &ldquo;and what is it, valiant knight, save an
      offering of sacrifice to a demon of vain glory, and a passing through the
      fire to Moloch?&mdash;What remains to you as the prize of all the blood
      you have spilled&mdash;of all the travail and pain you have endured&mdash;of
      all the tears which your deeds have caused, when death hath broken the
      strong man's spear, and overtaken the speed of his war-horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What remains?&rdquo; cried Ivanhoe; &ldquo;Glory, maiden, glory! which gilds our
      sepulchre and embalms our name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory?&rdquo; continued Rebecca; &ldquo;alas, is the rusted mail which hangs as a
      hatchment over the champion's dim and mouldering tomb&mdash;is the defaced
      sculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly read to
      the enquiring pilgrim&mdash;are these sufficient rewards for the sacrifice
      of every kindly affection, for a life spent miserably that ye may make
      others miserable? Or is there such virtue in the rude rhymes of a
      wandering bard, that domestic love, kindly affection, peace and happiness,
      are so wildly bartered, to become the hero of those ballads which vagabond
      minstrels sing to drunken churls over their evening ale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the soul of Hereward!&rdquo; replied the knight impatiently, &ldquo;thou speakest,
      maiden, of thou knowest not what. Thou wouldst quench the pure light of
      chivalry, which alone distinguishes the noble from the base, the gentle
      knight from the churl and the savage; which rates our life far, far
      beneath the pitch of our honour; raises us victorious over pain, toil, and
      suffering, and teaches us to fear no evil but disgrace. Thou art no
      Christian, Rebecca; and to thee are unknown those high feelings which
      swell the bosom of a noble maiden when her lover hath done some deed of
      emprize which sanctions his flame. Chivalry!&mdash;why, maiden, she is the
      nurse of pure and high affection&mdash;the stay of the oppressed, the
      redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the tyrant&mdash;Nobility
      were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds the best protection
      in her lance and her sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, indeed,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;sprung from a race whose courage was
      distinguished in the defence of their own land, but who warred not, even
      while yet a nation, save at the command of the Deity, or in defending
      their country from oppression. The sound of the trumpet wakes Judah no
      longer, and her despised children are now but the unresisting victims of
      hostile and military oppression. Well hast thou spoken, Sir Knight,&mdash;until
      the God of Jacob shall raise up for his chosen people a second Gideon, or
      a new Maccabeus, it ill beseemeth the Jewish damsel to speak of battle or
      of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The high-minded maiden concluded the argument in a tone of sorrow, which
      deeply expressed her sense of the degradation of her people, embittered
      perhaps by the idea that Ivanhoe considered her as one not entitled to
      interfere in a case of honour, and incapable of entertaining or expressing
      sentiments of honour and generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How little he knows this bosom,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to imagine that cowardice or
      meanness of soul must needs be its guests, because I have censured the
      fantastic chivalry of the Nazarenes! Would to heaven that the shedding of
      mine own blood, drop by drop, could redeem the captivity of Judah! Nay,
      would to God it could avail to set free my father, and this his
      benefactor, from the chains of the oppressor! The proud Christian should
      then see whether the daughter of God's chosen people dared not to die as
      bravely as the vainest Nazarene maiden, that boasts her descent from some
      petty chieftain of the rude and frozen north!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then looked towards the couch of the wounded knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sleeps,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;nature exhausted by sufferance and the waste of
      spirits, his wearied frame embraces the first moment of temporary
      relaxation to sink into slumber. Alas! is it a crime that I should look
      upon him, when it may be for the last time?&mdash;When yet but a short
      space, and those fair features will be no longer animated by the bold and
      buoyant spirit which forsakes them not even in sleep!&mdash;When the
      nostril shall be distended, the mouth agape, the eyes fixed and bloodshot;
      and when the proud and noble knight may be trodden on by the lowest
      caitiff of this accursed castle, yet stir not when the heel is lifted up
      against him!&mdash;And my father!&mdash;oh, my father! evil is it with his
      daughter, when his grey hairs are not remembered because of the golden
      locks of youth!&mdash;What know I but that these evils are the messengers
      of Jehovah's wrath to the unnatural child, who thinks of a stranger's
      captivity before a parent's? who forgets the desolation of Judah, and
      looks upon the comeliness of a Gentile and a stranger?&mdash;But I will
      tear this folly from my heart, though every fibre bleed as I rend it
      away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrapped herself closely in her veil, and sat down at a distance from
      the couch of the wounded knight, with her back turned towards it,
      fortifying, or endeavouring to fortify her mind, not only against the
      impending evils from without, but also against those treacherous feelings
      which assailed her from within.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Approach the chamber, look upon his bed.
     His is the passing of no peaceful ghost,
     Which, as the lark arises to the sky,
     'Mid morning's sweetest breeze and softest dew,
     Is wing'd to heaven by good men's sighs and tears!&mdash;

     &mdash;Old Play
</pre>
    <p>
      During the interval of quiet which followed the first success of the
      besiegers, while the one party was preparing to pursue their advantage,
      and the other to strengthen their means of defence, the Templar and De
      Bracy held brief council together in the hall of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Front-de-Boeuf?&rdquo; said the latter, who had superintended the
      defence of the fortress on the other side; &ldquo;men say he hath been slain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives,&rdquo; said the Templar, coolly, &ldquo;lives as yet; but had he worn the
      bull's head of which he bears the name, and ten plates of iron to fence it
      withal, he must have gone down before yonder fatal axe. Yet a few hours,
      and Front-de-Boeuf is with his fathers&mdash;a powerful limb lopped off
      Prince John's enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a brave addition to the kingdom of Satan,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;this comes
      of reviling saints and angels, and ordering images of holy things and holy
      men to be flung down on the heads of these rascaille yeomen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to&mdash;thou art a fool,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;thy superstition is upon
      a level with Front-de-Boeuf's want of faith; neither of you can render a
      reason for your belief or unbelief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benedicite, Sir Templar,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;pray you to keep better rule
      with your tongue when I am the theme of it. By the Mother of Heaven, I am
      a better Christian man than thou and thy fellowship; for the 'bruit' goeth
      shrewdly out, that the most holy Order of the Temple of Zion nurseth not a
      few heretics within its bosom, and that Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is of
      the number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care not thou for such reports,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;but let us think of
      making good the castle.&mdash;How fought these villain yeomen on thy
      side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like fiends incarnate,&rdquo; said De Bracy. &ldquo;They swarmed close up to the
      walls, headed, as I think, by the knave who won the prize at the archery,
      for I knew his horn and baldric. And this is old Fitzurse's boasted
      policy, encouraging these malapert knaves to rebel against us! Had I not
      been armed in proof, the villain had marked me down seven times with as
      little remorse as if I had been a buck in season. He told every rivet on
      my armour with a cloth-yard shaft, that rapped against my ribs with as
      little compunction as if my bones had been of iron&mdash;But that I wore a
      shirt of Spanish mail under my plate-coat, I had been fairly sped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you maintained your post?&rdquo; said the Templar. &ldquo;We lost the outwork on
      our part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a shrewd loss,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;the knaves will find cover there
      to assault the castle more closely, and may, if not well watched, gain
      some unguarded corner of a tower, or some forgotten window, and so break
      in upon us. Our numbers are too few for the defence of every point, and
      the men complain that they can nowhere show themselves, but they are the
      mark for as many arrows as a parish-butt on a holyday even. Front-de-Boeuf
      is dying too, so we shall receive no more aid from his bull's head and
      brutal strength. How think you, Sir Brian, were we not better make a
      virtue of necessity, and compound with the rogues by delivering up our
      prisoners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; exclaimed the Templar; &ldquo;deliver up our prisoners, and stand an
      object alike of ridicule and execration, as the doughty warriors who dared
      by a night-attack to possess themselves of the persons of a party of
      defenceless travellers, yet could not make good a strong castle against a
      vagabond troop of outlaws, led by swineherds, jesters, and the very refuse
      of mankind?&mdash;Shame on thy counsel, Maurice de Bracy!&mdash;The ruins
      of this castle shall bury both my body and my shame, ere I consent to such
      base and dishonourable composition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us to the walls, then,&rdquo; said De Bracy, carelessly; &ldquo;that man never
      breathed, be he Turk or Templar, who held life at lighter rate than I do.
      But I trust there is no dishonour in wishing I had here some two scores of
      my gallant troop of Free Companions?&mdash;Oh, my brave lances! if ye knew
      but how hard your captain were this day bested, how soon should I see my
      banner at the head of your clump of spears! And how short while would
      these rabble villains stand to endure your encounter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish for whom thou wilt,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;but let us make what defence
      we can with the soldiers who remain&mdash;They are chiefly
      Front-de-Boeuf's followers, hated by the English for a thousand acts of
      insolence and oppression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;the rugged slaves will defend themselves to
      the last drop of their blood, ere they encounter the revenge of the
      peasants without. Let us up and be doing, then, Brian de Bois-Guilbert;
      and, live or die, thou shalt see Maurice de Bracy bear himself this day as
      a gentleman of blood and lineage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the walls!&rdquo; answered the Templar; and they both ascended the
      battlements to do all that skill could dictate, and manhood accomplish, in
      defence of the place. They readily agreed that the point of greatest
      danger was that opposite to the outwork of which the assailants had
      possessed themselves. The castle, indeed, was divided from that barbican
      by the moat, and it was impossible that the besiegers could assail the
      postern-door, with which the outwork corresponded, without surmounting
      that obstacle; but it was the opinion both of the Templar and De Bracy,
      that the besiegers, if governed by the same policy their leader had
      already displayed, would endeavour, by a formidable assault, to draw the
      chief part of the defenders' observation to this point, and take measures
      to avail themselves of every negligence which might take place in the
      defence elsewhere. To guard against such an evil, their numbers only
      permitted the knights to place sentinels from space to space along the
      walls in communication with each other, who might give the alarm whenever
      danger was threatened. Meanwhile, they agreed that De Bracy should command
      the defence at the postern, and the Templar should keep with him a score
      of men or thereabouts as a body of reserve, ready to hasten to any other
      point which might be suddenly threatened. The loss of the barbican had
      also this unfortunate effect, that, notwithstanding the superior height of
      the castle walls, the besieged could not see from them, with the same
      precision as before, the operations of the enemy; for some straggling
      underwood approached so near the sallyport of the outwork, that the
      assailants might introduce into it whatever force they thought proper, not
      only under cover, but even without the knowledge of the defenders. Utterly
      uncertain, therefore, upon what point the storm was to burst, De Bracy and
      his companion were under the necessity of providing against every possible
      contingency, and their followers, however brave, experienced the anxious
      dejection of mind incident to men enclosed by enemies, who possessed the
      power of choosing their time and mode of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the lord of the beleaguered and endangered castle lay upon a
      bed of bodily pain and mental agony. He had not the usual resource of
      bigots in that superstitious period, most of whom were wont to atone for
      the crimes they were guilty of by liberality to the church, stupefying by
      this means their terrors by the idea of atonement and forgiveness; and
      although the refuge which success thus purchased, was no more like to the
      peace of mind which follows on sincere repentance, than the turbid
      stupefaction procured by opium resembles healthy and natural slumbers, it
      was still a state of mind preferable to the agonies of awakened remorse.
      But among the vices of Front-de-Boeuf, a hard and griping man, avarice was
      predominant; and he preferred setting church and churchmen at defiance, to
      purchasing from them pardon and absolution at the price of treasure and of
      manors. Nor did the Templar, an infidel of another stamp, justly
      characterise his associate, when he said Front-de-Boeuf could assign no
      cause for his unbelief and contempt for the established faith; for the
      Baron would have alleged that the Church sold her wares too dear, that the
      spiritual freedom which she put up to sale was only to be bought like that
      of the chief captain of Jerusalem, &ldquo;with a great sum,&rdquo; and Front-de-Boeuf
      preferred denying the virtue of the medicine, to paying the expense of the
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the moment had now arrived when earth and all his treasures were
      gliding from before his eyes, and when the savage Baron's heart, though
      hard as a nether millstone, became appalled as he gazed forward into the
      waste darkness of futurity. The fever of his body aided the impatience and
      agony of his mind, and his death-bed exhibited a mixture of the newly
      awakened feelings of horror, combating with the fixed and inveterate
      obstinacy of his disposition;&mdash;a fearful state of mind, only to be
      equalled in those tremendous regions, where there are complaints without
      hope, remorse without repentance, a dreadful sense of present agony, and a
      presentiment that it cannot cease or be diminished!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where be these dog-priests now,&rdquo; growled the Baron, &ldquo;who set such price
      on their ghostly mummery?&mdash;where be all those unshod Carmelites, for
      whom old Front-de-Boeuf founded the convent of St Anne, robbing his heir
      of many a fair rood of meadow, and many a fat field and close&mdash;where
      be the greedy hounds now?&mdash;Swilling, I warrant me, at the ale, or
      playing their juggling tricks at the bedside of some miserly churl.&mdash;Me,
      the heir of their founder&mdash;me, whom their foundation binds them to
      pray for&mdash;me&mdash;ungrateful villains as they are!&mdash;they suffer
      to die like the houseless dog on yonder common, unshriven and unhouseled!&mdash;Tell
      the Templar to come hither&mdash;he is a priest, and may do something&mdash;But
      no!&mdash;as well confess myself to the devil as to Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, who recks neither of heaven nor of hell.&mdash;I have heard
      old men talk of prayer&mdash;prayer by their own voice&mdash;Such need not
      to court or to bribe the false priest&mdash;But I&mdash;I dare not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lives Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; said a broken and shrill voice close by
      his bedside, &ldquo;to say there is that which he dares not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evil conscience and the shaken nerves of Front-de-Boeuf heard, in this
      strange interruption to his soliloquy, the voice of one of those demons,
      who, as the superstition of the times believed, beset the beds of dying
      men to distract their thoughts, and turn them from the meditations which
      concerned their eternal welfare. He shuddered and drew himself together;
      but, instantly summoning up his wonted resolution, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Who is
      there?&mdash;what art thou, that darest to echo my words in a tone like
      that of the night-raven?&mdash;Come before my couch that I may see thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thine evil angel, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; replied the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me behold thee then in thy bodily shape, if thou be'st indeed a
      fiend,&rdquo; replied the dying knight; &ldquo;think not that I will blench from thee.&mdash;By
      the eternal dungeon, could I but grapple with these horrors that hover
      round me, as I have done with mortal dangers, heaven or hell should never
      say that I shrunk from the conflict!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think on thy sins, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; said the almost unearthly
      voice, &ldquo;on rebellion, on rapine, on murder!&mdash;Who stirred up the
      licentious John to war against his grey-headed father&mdash;against his
      generous brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be thou fiend, priest, or devil,&rdquo; replied Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;thou liest in
      thy throat!&mdash;Not I stirred John to rebellion&mdash;not I alone&mdash;there
      were fifty knights and barons, the flower of the midland counties&mdash;better
      men never laid lance in rest&mdash;And must I answer for the fault done by
      fifty?&mdash;False fiend, I defy thee! Depart, and haunt my couch no more&mdash;let
      me die in peace if thou be mortal&mdash;if thou be a demon, thy time is
      not yet come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In peace thou shalt NOT die,&rdquo; repeated the voice; &ldquo;even in death shalt
      thou think on thy murders&mdash;on the groans which this castle has echoed&mdash;on
      the blood that is engrained in its floors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou canst not shake me by thy petty malice,&rdquo; answered Front-de-Boeuf,
      with a ghastly and constrained laugh. &ldquo;The infidel Jew&mdash;it was merit
      with heaven to deal with him as I did, else wherefore are men canonized
      who dip their hands in the blood of Saracens?&mdash;The Saxon porkers,
      whom I have slain, they were the foes of my country, and of my lineage,
      and of my liege lord.&mdash;Ho! ho! thou seest there is no crevice in my
      coat of plate&mdash;Art thou fled?&mdash;art thou silenced?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, foul parricide!&rdquo; replied the voice; &ldquo;think of thy father!&mdash;think
      of his death!&mdash;think of his banquet-room flooded with his gore, and
      that poured forth by the hand of a son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; answered the Baron, after a long pause, &ldquo;an thou knowest that, thou
      art indeed the author of evil, and as omniscient as the monks call thee!&mdash;That
      secret I deemed locked in my own breast, and in that of one besides&mdash;the
      temptress, the partaker of my guilt.&mdash;Go, leave me, fiend! and seek
      the Saxon witch Ulrica, who alone could tell thee what she and I alone
      witnessed.&mdash;Go, I say, to her, who washed the wounds, and straighted
      the corpse, and gave to the slain man the outward show of one parted in
      time and in the course of nature&mdash;Go to her, she was my temptress,
      the foul provoker, the more foul rewarder, of the deed&mdash;let her, as
      well as I, taste of the tortures which anticipate hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She already tastes them,&rdquo; said Ulrica, stepping before the couch of
      Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;she hath long drunken of this cup, and its bitterness is
      now sweetened to see that thou dost partake it.&mdash;Grind not thy teeth,
      Front-de-Boeuf&mdash;roll not thine eyes&mdash;clench not thine hand, nor
      shake it at me with that gesture of menace!&mdash;The hand which, like
      that of thy renowned ancestor who gained thy name, could have broken with
      one stroke the skull of a mountain-bull, is now unnerved and powerless as
      mine own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vile murderous hag!&rdquo; replied Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;detestable screech-owl! it
      is then thou who art come to exult over the ruins thou hast assisted to
      lay low?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;it is Ulrica!&mdash;it is
      the daughter of the murdered Torquil Wolfganger!&mdash;it is the sister of
      his slaughtered sons!&mdash;it is she who demands of thee, and of thy
      father's house, father and kindred, name and fame&mdash;all that she has
      lost by the name of Front-de-Boeuf!&mdash;Think of my wrongs,
      Front-de-Boeuf, and answer me if I speak not truth. Thou hast been my evil
      angel, and I will be thine&mdash;I will dog thee till the very instant of
      dissolution!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detestable fury!&rdquo; exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf, &ldquo;that moment shalt thou never
      witness&mdash;Ho! Giles, Clement, and Eustace! Saint Maur, and Stephen!
      seize this damned witch, and hurl her from the battlements headlong&mdash;she
      has betrayed us to the Saxon!&mdash;Ho! Saint Maur! Clement!
      false-hearted, knaves, where tarry ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call on them again, valiant Baron,&rdquo; said the hag, with a smile of grisly
      mockery; &ldquo;summon thy vassals around thee, doom them that loiter to the
      scourge and the dungeon&mdash;But know, mighty chief,&rdquo; she continued,
      suddenly changing her tone, &ldquo;thou shalt have neither answer, nor aid, nor
      obedience at their hands.&mdash;Listen to these horrid sounds,&rdquo; for the
      din of the recommenced assault and defence now rung fearfully loud from
      the battlements of the castle; &ldquo;in that war-cry is the downfall of thy
      house&mdash;The blood-cemented fabric of Front-de-Boeuf's power totters to
      the foundation, and before the foes he most despised!&mdash;The Saxon,
      Reginald!&mdash;the scorned Saxon assails thy walls!&mdash;Why liest thou
      here, like a worn-out hind, when the Saxon storms thy place of strength?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gods and fiends!&rdquo; exclaimed the wounded knight; &ldquo;O, for one moment's
      strength, to drag myself to the 'melee', and perish as becomes my name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of it, valiant warrior!&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;thou shalt die no
      soldier's death, but perish like the fox in his den, when the peasants
      have set fire to the cover around it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hateful hag! thou liest!&rdquo; exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf; &ldquo;my followers bear
      them bravely&mdash;my walls are strong and high&mdash;my comrades in arms
      fear not a whole host of Saxons, were they headed by Hengist and Horsa!&mdash;The
      war-cry of the Templar and of the Free Companions rises high over the
      conflict! And by mine honour, when we kindle the blazing beacon, for joy
      of our defence, it shall consume thee, body and bones; and I shall live to
      hear thou art gone from earthly fires to those of that hell, which never
      sent forth an incarnate fiend more utterly diabolical!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold thy belief,&rdquo; replied Ulrica, &ldquo;till the proof reach thee&mdash;But,
      no!&rdquo; she said, interrupting herself, &ldquo;thou shalt know, even now, the doom,
      which all thy power, strength, and courage, is unable to avoid, though it
      is prepared for thee by this feeble band. Markest thou the smouldering and
      suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds through the
      chamber?&mdash;Didst thou think it was but the darkening of thy bursting
      eyes&mdash;the difficulty of thy cumbered breathing?&mdash;No!
      Front-de-Boeuf, there is another cause&mdash;Rememberest thou the magazine
      of fuel that is stored beneath these apartments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed with fury, &ldquo;thou hast not set fire to it?&mdash;By
      heaven, thou hast, and the castle is in flames!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are fast rising at least,&rdquo; said Ulrica, with frightful composure;
      &ldquo;and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon
      those who would extinguish them.&mdash;Farewell, Front-de-Boeuf!&mdash;May
      Mista, Skogula, and Zernebock, gods of the ancient Saxons&mdash;fiends, as
      the priests now call them&mdash;supply the place of comforters at your
      dying bed, which Ulrica now relinquishes!&mdash;But know, if it will give
      thee comfort to know it, that Ulrica is bound to the same dark coast with
      thyself, the companion of thy punishment as the companion of thy guilt.&mdash;And
      now, parricide, farewell for ever!&mdash;May each stone of this vaulted
      roof find a tongue to echo that title into thine ear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she left the apartment; and Front-de-Boeuf could hear the crash
      of the ponderous key, as she locked and double-locked the door behind her,
      thus cutting off the most slender chance of escape. In the extremity of
      agony he shouted upon his servants and allies&mdash;&ldquo;Stephen and Saint
      Maur!&mdash;Clement and Giles!&mdash;I burn here unaided!&mdash;To the
      rescue&mdash;to the rescue, brave Bois-Guilbert, valiant De Bracy!&mdash;It
      is Front-de-Boeuf who calls!&mdash;It is your master, ye traitor squires!&mdash;Your
      ally&mdash;your brother in arms, ye perjured and faithless knights!&mdash;all
      the curses due to traitors upon your recreant heads, do you abandon me to
      perish thus miserably!&mdash;They hear me not&mdash;they cannot hear me&mdash;my
      voice is lost in the din of battle.&mdash;The smoke rolls thicker and
      thicker&mdash;the fire has caught upon the floor below&mdash;O, for one
      drought of the air of heaven, were it to be purchased by instant
      annihilation!&rdquo; And in the mad frenzy of despair, the wretch now shouted
      with the shouts of the fighters, now muttered curses on himself, on
      mankind, and on Heaven itself.&mdash;&ldquo;The red fire flashes through the
      thick smoke!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;the demon marches against me under the banner
      of his own element&mdash;Foul spirit, avoid!&mdash;I go not with thee
      without my comrades&mdash;all, all are thine, that garrison these walls&mdash;Thinkest
      thou Front-de-Boeuf will be singled out to go alone?&mdash;No&mdash;the
      infidel Templar&mdash;the licentious De Bracy&mdash;Ulrica, the foul
      murdering strumpet&mdash;the men who aided my enterprises&mdash;the dog
      Saxons and accursed Jews, who are my prisoners&mdash;all, all shall attend
      me&mdash;a goodly fellowship as ever took the downward road&mdash;Ha, ha,
      ha!&rdquo; and he laughed in his frenzy till the vaulted roof rang again. &ldquo;Who
      laughed there?&rdquo; exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf, in altered mood, for the noise
      of the conflict did not prevent the echoes of his own mad laughter from
      returning upon his ear&mdash;&ldquo;who laughed there?&mdash;Ulrica, was it
      thou?&mdash;Speak, witch, and I forgive thee&mdash;for, only thou or the
      fiend of hell himself could have laughed at such a moment. Avaunt&mdash;avaunt!&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it were impious to trace any farther the picture of the blasphemer and
      parricide's deathbed.

      Cedric, although not greatly confident in Ulrica's message, omitted not to
      communicate her promise to the Black Knight and Locksley. They were well
      pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in the
      moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily agreed
      with the Saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought to be
      attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in the hands
      of the cruel Front-de-Boeuf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The royal blood of Alfred is endangered,&rdquo; said Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The honour of a noble lady is in peril,&rdquo; said the Black Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, by the Saint Christopher at my baldric,&rdquo; said the good yeoman, &ldquo;were
      there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful knave, Wamba, I
      would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so would I,&rdquo; said the Friar; &ldquo;what, sirs! I trust well that a fool&mdash;I
      mean, d'ye see me, sirs, a fool that is free of his guild and master of
      his craft, and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup of wine as
      ever a flitch of bacon can&mdash;I say, brethren, such a fool shall never
      want a wise clerk to pray for or fight for him at a strait, while I can
      say a mass or flourish a partisan.&rdquo; And with that he made his heavy
      halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his light
      crook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, Holy Clerk,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;true as if Saint Dunstan
      himself had said it.&mdash;And now, good Locksley, were it not well that
      noble Cedric should assume the direction of this assault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a jot I,&rdquo; returned Cedric; &ldquo;I have never been wont to study either
      how to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power, which the
      Normans have erected in this groaning land. I will fight among the
      foremost; but my honest neighbours well know I am not a trained soldier in
      the discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it stands thus with noble Cedric,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;I am most
      willing to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shall hang me
      up on my own Trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show
      themselves over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as there
      are cloves in a gammon of bacon at Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, stout yeoman,&rdquo; answered the Black Knight; &ldquo;and if I be thought
      worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can find among these brave
      men as many as are willing to follow a true English knight, for so I may
      surely call myself, I am ready, with such skill as my experience has
      taught me, to lead them to the attack of these walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the first
      assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the barbican was carried, the Sable Knight sent notice of the happy
      event to Locksley, requesting him at the same time, to keep such a strict
      observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from combining
      their force for a sudden sally, and recovering the outwork which they had
      lost. This the knight was chiefly desirous of avoiding, conscious that the
      men whom he led, being hasty and untrained volunteers, imperfectly armed
      and unaccustomed to discipline, must, upon any sudden attack, fight at
      great disadvantage with the veteran soldiers of the Norman knights, who
      were well provided with arms both defensive and offensive; and who, to
      match the zeal and high spirit of the besiegers, had all the confidence
      which arises from perfect discipline and the habitual use of weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of
      floating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the
      moat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. This was a work of some
      time, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gave Ulrica leisure to
      execute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the raft was completed, the Black Knight addressed the besiegers:&mdash;&ldquo;It
      avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is descending to the
      west&mdash;and I have that upon my hands which will not permit me to tarry
      with you another day. Besides, it will be a marvel if the horsemen come
      not upon us from York, unless we speedily accomplish our purpose.
      Wherefore, one of ye go to Locksley, and bid him commence a discharge of
      arrows on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward as if about to
      assault it; and you, true English hearts, stand by me, and be ready to
      thrust the raft endlong over the moat whenever the postern on our side is
      thrown open. Follow me boldly across, and aid me to burst yon sallyport in
      the main wall of the castle. As many of you as like not this service, or
      are but ill armed to meet it, do you man the top of the outwork, draw your
      bow-strings to your ears, and mind you quell with your shot whatever shall
      appear to man the rampart&mdash;Noble Cedric, wilt thou take the direction
      of those which remain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, by the soul of Hereward!&rdquo; said the Saxon; &ldquo;lead I cannot; but may
      posterity curse me in my grave, if I follow not with the foremost wherever
      thou shalt point the way&mdash;The quarrel is mine, and well it becomes me
      to be in the van of the battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, bethink thee, noble Saxon,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;thou hast neither
      hauberk, nor corslet, nor aught but that light helmet, target, and sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better!&rdquo; answered Cedric; &ldquo;I shall be the lighter to climb these
      walls. And,&mdash;forgive the boast, Sir Knight,&mdash;thou shalt this day
      see the naked breast of a Saxon as boldly presented to the battle as ever
      ye beheld the steel corslet of a Norman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God, then,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;fling open the door, and
      launch the floating bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat, and
      which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle, was
      now suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward, and
      soon flashed in the waters, extending its length between the castle and
      outwork, and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men abreast
      to cross the moat. Well aware of the importance of taking the foe by
      surprise, the Black Knight, closely followed by Cedric, threw himself upon
      the bridge, and reached the opposite side. Here he began to thunder with
      his axe upon the gate of the castle, protected in part from the shot and
      stones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the former drawbridge, which
      the Templar had demolished in his retreat from the barbican, leaving the
      counterpoise still attached to the upper part of the portal. The followers
      of the knight had no such shelter; two were instantly shot with cross-bow
      bolts, and two more fell into the moat; the others retreated back into the
      barbican.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of Cedric and of the Black Knight was now truly dangerous,
      and would have been still more so, but for the constancy of the archers in
      the barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon the battlements,
      distracting the attention of those by whom they were manned, and thus
      affording a respite to their two chiefs from the storm of missiles which
      must otherwise have overwhelmed them. But their situation was eminently
      perilous, and was becoming more so with every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on ye all!&rdquo; cried De Bracy to the soldiers around him; &ldquo;do ye call
      yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their station under
      the walls of the castle?&mdash;Heave over the coping stones from the
      battlements, an better may not be&mdash;Get pick-axe and levers, and down
      with that huge pinnacle!&rdquo; pointing to a heavy piece of stone carved-work
      that projected from the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle
      of the tower which Ulrica had described to Cedric. The stout yeoman
      Locksley was the first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the
      outwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint George!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Merry Saint George for England!&mdash;To the
      charge, bold yeomen!&mdash;why leave ye the good knight and noble Cedric
      to storm the pass alone?&mdash;make in, mad priest, show thou canst fight
      for thy rosary,&mdash;make in, brave yeomen!&mdash;the castle is ours, we
      have friends within&mdash;See yonder flag, it is the appointed signal&mdash;Torquilstone
      is ours!&mdash;Think of honour, think of spoil&mdash;One effort, and the
      place is ours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the breast
      of one of the men-at-arms, who, under De Bracy's direction, was loosening
      a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the heads of
      Cedric and the Black Knight. A second soldier caught from the hands of the
      dying man the iron crow, with which he heaved at and had loosened the
      stone pinnacle, when, receiving an arrow through his head-piece, he
      dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man. The men-at-arms
      were daunted, for no armour seemed proof against the shot of this
      tremendous archer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you give ground, base knaves!&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;'Mount joye Saint
      Dennis!'&mdash;Give me the lever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was
      of weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the remnant
      of the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also
      to have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had crossed. All saw
      the danger, and the boldest, even the stout Friar himself, avoided setting
      foot on the raft. Thrice did Locksley bend his shaft against De Bracy, and
      thrice did his arrow bound back from the knight's armour of proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse on thy Spanish steel-coat!&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;had English smith
      forged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been silk or
      sendal.&rdquo; He then began to call out, &ldquo;Comrades! friends! noble Cedric! bear
      back, and let the ruin fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself
      occasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty
      war-trumpets. The faithful Gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked
      bridge, to warn Cedric of his impending fate, or to share it with him. But
      his warning would have come too late; the massive pinnacle already
      tottered, and De Bracy, who still heaved at his task, would have
      accomplished it, had not the voice of the Templar sounded close in his
      ears:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is lost, De Bracy, the castle burns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art mad to say so!&rdquo; replied the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all in a light flame on the western side. I have striven in vain to
      extinguish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character, Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert communicated this hideous intelligence, which was not so
      calmly received by his astonished comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints of Paradise!&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;what is to be done? I vow to Saint
      Nicholas of Limoges a candlestick of pure gold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare thy vow,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;and mark me. Lead thy men down, as if
      to a sally; throw the postern-gate open&mdash;There are but two men who
      occupy the float, fling them into the moat, and push across for the
      barbican. I will charge from the main gate, and attack the barbican on the
      outside; and if we can regain that post, be assured we shall defend
      ourselves until we are relieved, or at least till they grant us fair
      quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well thought upon,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I will play my part&mdash;Templar,
      thou wilt not fail me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand and glove, I will not!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;But haste thee, in the
      name of God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the
      postern-gate, which he caused instantly to be thrown open. But scarce was
      this done ere the portentous strength of the Black Knight forced his way
      inward in despite of De Bracy and his followers. Two of the foremost
      instantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leader's
      efforts to stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;will ye let TWO men win our only pass for safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the devil!&rdquo; said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the blows
      of their sable antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he be the devil,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;would you fly from him into
      the mouth of hell?&mdash;the castle burns behind us, villains!&mdash;let
      despair give you courage, or let me forward! I will cope with this
      champion myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And well and chivalrous did De Bracy that day maintain the fame he had
      acquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period. The vaulted passage to
      which the postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted
      champions were now fighting hand to hand, rung with the furious blows
      which they dealt each other, De Bracy with his sword, the Black Knight
      with his ponderous axe. At length the Norman received a blow, which,
      though its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never
      more would De Bracy have again moved limb, descended yet with such
      violence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yield thee, De Bracy,&rdquo; said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and
      holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the
      knights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of
      mercy,)&mdash;&ldquo;yield thee, Maurice de Bracy, rescue or no rescue, or thou
      art but a dead man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not yield,&rdquo; replied De Bracy faintly, &ldquo;to an unknown conqueror.
      Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me&mdash;it shall never be said
      that Maurice de Bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Black Knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,&rdquo; answered the
      Norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of
      deep though sullen submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the barbican,&rdquo; said the victor, in a tone of authority, &ldquo;and there
      wait my further orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet first, let me say,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;what it imports thee to know.
      Wilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the
      burning castle without present help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilfred of Ivanhoe!&rdquo; exclaimed the Black Knight&mdash;&ldquo;prisoner, and
      perish!&mdash;The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a
      hair of his head be singed&mdash;Show me his chamber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ascend yonder winding stair,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;it leads to his apartment&mdash;Wilt
      thou not accept my guidance?&rdquo; he added, in a submissive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. To the barbican, and there wait my orders. I trust thee not, De
      Bracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, Cedric, at the
      head of a body of men, among whom the Friar was conspicuous, had pushed
      across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and drove back the
      dispirited and despairing followers of De Bracy, of whom some asked
      quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part fled towards
      the court-yard. De Bracy himself arose from the ground, and cast a
      sorrowful glance after his conqueror. &ldquo;He trusts me not!&rdquo; he repeated;
      &ldquo;but have I deserved his trust?&rdquo; He then lifted his sword from the floor,
      took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going to the barbican,
      gave up his sword to Locksley, whom he met by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the chamber,
      where Ivanhoe was watched and tended by the Jewess Rebecca. He had been
      awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and his
      attendant, who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself at the
      window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was for some
      time prevented from observing either, by the increase of the smouldering
      and stifling vapour. At length the volumes of smoke which rolled into the
      apartment&mdash;the cries for water, which were heard even above the din
      of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this new danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The castle burns,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;it burns!&mdash;What can we do to save
      ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly, Rebecca, and save thine own life,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;for no human aid
      can avail me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fly,&rdquo; answered Rebecca; &ldquo;we will be saved or perish together&mdash;And
      yet, great God!&mdash;my father, my father&mdash;what will be his fate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door of the apartment flew open, and the Templar
      presented himself,&mdash;a ghastly figure, for his gilded armour was
      broken and bloody, and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from
      his casque. &ldquo;I have found thee,&rdquo; said he to Rebecca; &ldquo;thou shalt prove I
      will keep my word to share weal and woe with thee&mdash;There is but one
      path to safety, I have cut my way through fifty dangers to point it to
      thee&mdash;up, and instantly follow me!&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-38"      name="linknoteref-38" id="linknoteref-38"><small>38</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;I will not follow thee. If thou wert born of
      woman&mdash;if thou hast but a touch of human charity in thee&mdash;if thy
      heart be not hard as thy breastplate&mdash;save my aged father&mdash;save
      this wounded knight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A knight,&rdquo; answered the Templar, with his characteristic calmness, &ldquo;a
      knight, Rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meet him in the shape
      of sword or flame&mdash;and who recks how or where a Jew meets with his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Savage warrior,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;rather will I perish in the flames than
      accept safety from thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt not choose, Rebecca&mdash;once didst thou foil me, but never
      mortal did so twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with her
      shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her cries,
      and without regarding the menaces and defiance which Ivanhoe thundered
      against him. &ldquo;Hound of the Temple&mdash;stain to thine Order&mdash;set
      free the damsel! Traitor of Bois-Guilbert, it is Ivanhoe commands thee!&mdash;Villain,
      I will have thy heart's blood!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not found thee, Wilfred,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, who at that
      instant entered the apartment, &ldquo;but for thy shouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou be'st true knight,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;think not of me&mdash;pursue
      yon ravisher&mdash;save the Lady Rowena&mdash;look to the noble Cedric!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their turn,&rdquo; answered he of the Fetterlock, &ldquo;but thine is first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And seizing upon Ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the Templar
      had carried off Rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and having there
      delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again entered the
      castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      One turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from
      window and shot-hole. But in other parts, the great thickness of the walls
      and the vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress of the
      flames, and there the rage of man still triumphed, as the scarce more
      dreadful element held mastery elsewhere; for the besiegers pursued the
      defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber, and satiated in their
      blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of
      the tyrant Front-de-Boeuf. Most of the garrison resisted to the uttermost&mdash;few
      of them asked quarter&mdash;none received it. The air was filled with
      groans and clashing of arms&mdash;the floors were slippery with the blood
      of despairing and expiring wretches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this scene of confusion, Cedric rushed in quest of Rowena, while
      the faithful Gurth, following him closely through the &ldquo;melee&rdquo;, neglected
      his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at his
      master. The noble Saxon was so fortunate as to reach his ward's apartment
      just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a crucifix clasped
      in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of instant death. He committed
      her to the charge of Gurth, to be conducted in safety to the barbican, the
      road to which was now cleared of the enemy, and not yet interrupted by the
      flames. This accomplished, the loyal Cedric hastened in quest of his
      friend Athelstane, determined, at every risk to himself, to save that last
      scion of Saxon royalty. But ere Cedric penetrated as far as the old hall
      in which he had himself been a prisoner, the inventive genius of Wamba had
      procured liberation for himself and his companion in adversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest, the
      Jester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, &ldquo;Saint George
      and the dragon!&mdash;Bonny Saint George for merry England!&mdash;The
      castle is won!&rdquo; And these sounds he rendered yet more fearful, by banging
      against each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered
      around the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A guard, which had been stationed in the outer, or anteroom, and whose
      spirits were already in a state of alarm, took fright at Wamba's clamour,
      and, leaving the door open behind them, ran to tell the Templar that
      foemen had entered the old hall. Meantime the prisoners found no
      difficulty in making their escape into the anteroom, and from thence into
      the court of the castle, which was now the last scene of contest. Here sat
      the fierce Templar, mounted on horseback, surrounded by several of the
      garrison both on horse and foot, who had united their strength to that of
      this renowned leader, in order to secure the last chance of safety and
      retreat which remained to them. The drawbridge had been lowered by his
      orders, but the passage was beset; for the archers, who had hitherto only
      annoyed the castle on that side by their missiles, no sooner saw the
      flames breaking out, and the bridge lowered, than they thronged to the
      entrance, as well to prevent the escape of the garrison, as to secure
      their own share of booty ere the castle should be burnt down. On the other
      hand, a party of the besiegers who had entered by the postern were now
      issuing out into the court-yard, and attacking with fury the remnant of
      the defenders who were thus assaulted on both sides at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their
      indomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with the
      utmost valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in driving
      back the assailants, though much inferior in numbers. Rebecca, placed on
      horseback before one of the Templar's Saracen slaves, was in the midst of
      the little party; and Bois-Guilbert, notwithstanding the confusion of the
      bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety. Repeatedly he was by
      her side, and, neglecting his own defence, held before her the fence of
      his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon starting from his position by
      her, he cried his war-cry, dashed forward, struck to earth the most
      forward of the assailants, and was on the same instant once more at her
      bridle rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly,
      beheld the female form whom the Templar protected thus sedulously, and
      doubted not that it was Rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in
      despite of all resistance which could be offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the soul of Saint Edward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will rescue her from yonder
      over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what you do!&rdquo; cried Wamba; &ldquo;hasty hand catches frog for fish&mdash;by
      my bauble, yonder is none of my Lady Rowena&mdash;see but her long dark
      locks!&mdash;Nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be leader,
      but I will be no follower&mdash;no bones of mine shall be broken unless I
      know for whom.&mdash;And you without armour too!&mdash;Bethink you, silk
      bonnet never kept out steel blade.&mdash;Nay, then, if wilful will to
      water, wilful must drench.&mdash;'Deus vobiscum', most doughty
      Athelstane!&rdquo;&mdash;he concluded, loosening the hold which he had hitherto
      kept upon the Saxon's tunic.
    </p>
    <p>
      To snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose dying
      grasp had just relinquished it&mdash;to rush on the Templar's band, and to
      strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a warrior at
      each blow, was, for Athelstane's great strength, now animated with unusual
      fury, but the work of a single moment; he was soon within two yards of
      Bois-Guilbert, whom he defied in his loudest tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn, false-hearted Templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to touch&mdash;turn,
      limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; said the Templar, grinding his teeth, &ldquo;I will teach thee to
      blaspheme the holy Order of the Temple of Zion;&rdquo; and with these words,
      half-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the Saxon, and
      rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent of the
      horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of Athelstane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well said Wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. So trenchant
      was the Templar's weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had been a willow
      twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the ill-fated Saxon
      reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head, levelled him with
      the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ha! Beau-seant!'&rdquo; exclaimed Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;thus be it to the maligners
      of the Temple-knights!&rdquo; Taking advantage of the dismay which was spread by
      the fall of Athelstane, and calling aloud, &ldquo;Those who would save
      themselves, follow me!&rdquo; he pushed across the drawbridge, dispersing the
      archers who would have intercepted them. He was followed by his Saracens,
      and some five or six men-at-arms, who had mounted their horses. The
      Templar's retreat was rendered perilous by the numbers of arrows shot off
      at him and his party; but this did not prevent him from galloping round to
      the barbican, of which, according to his previous plan, he supposed it
      possible De Bracy might have been in possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Bracy! De Bracy!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;art thou there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;but I am a prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I rescue thee?&rdquo; cried Bois-Guilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied De Bracy; &ldquo;I have rendered me, rescue or no rescue. I will
      be true prisoner. Save thyself&mdash;there are hawks abroad&mdash;put the
      seas betwixt you and England&mdash;I dare not say more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the Templar, &ldquo;an thou wilt tarry there, remember I have
      redeemed word and glove. Be the hawks where they will, methinks the walls
      of the Preceptory of Templestowe will be cover sufficient, and thither
      will I, like heron to her haunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued to fight
      desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of the Templar, but
      rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any hope of
      escape. The fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of the castle,
      when Ulrica, who had first kindled it, appeared on a turret, in the guise
      of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song, such as was of
      yore raised on the field of battle by the scalds of the yet heathen
      Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her uncovered head;
      the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with
      the fire of insanity; and she brandished the distaff which she held in her
      hand, as if she had been one of the Fatal Sisters, who spin and abridge
      the thread of human life. Tradition has preserved some wild strophes of
      the barbarous hymn which she chanted wildly amid that scene of fire and of
      slaughter:&mdash;

    <p>
      The towering flames had now surmounted every obstruction, and rose to the
      evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide through the
      adjacent country. Tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof and
      rafter; and the combatants were driven from the court-yard. The
      vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the
      neighbouring wood. The victors, assembling in large bands, gazed with
      wonder, not unmixed with fear, upon the flames, in which their own ranks
      and arms glanced dusky red. The maniac figure of the Saxon Ulrica was for
      a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing her arms
      abroad with wild exultation, as if she reined empress of the conflagration
      which she had raised. At length, with a terrific crash, the whole turret
      gave way, and she perished in the flames which had consumed her tyrant. An
      awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of the armed spectators, who,
      for the space of several minutes, stirred not a finger, save to sign the
      cross. The voice of Locksley was then heard, &ldquo;Shout, yeomen!&mdash;the den
      of tyrants is no more! Let each bring his spoil to our chosen place of
      rendezvous at the Trysting-tree in the Harthill-walk; for there at break
      of day will we make just partition among our own bands, together with our
      worthy allies in this great deed of vengeance.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Trust me each state must have its policies:
     Kingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters;
     Even the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk,
     Keeps yet some touch of civil discipline;
     For not since Adam wore his verdant apron,
     Hath man with man in social union dwelt,
     But laws were made to draw that union closer.
     &mdash;Old Play
</pre>
    <p>
      The daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest. The green
      boughs glittered with all their pearls of dew. The hind led her fawn from
      the covert of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood, and no
      huntsman was there to watch or intercept the stately hart, as he paced at
      the head of the antler'd herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outlaws were all assembled around the Trysting-tree in the
      Harthill-walk, where they had spent the night in refreshing themselves
      after the fatigues of the siege, some with wine, some with slumber, many
      with hearing and recounting the events of the day, and computing the heaps
      of plunder which their success had placed at the disposal of their Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spoils were indeed very large; for, notwithstanding that much was
      consumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing, had
      been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be
      appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. Yet so strict were
      the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any part of
      the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the disposal
      of their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which
      Locksley had conducted Gurth and Wamba in the earlier part of the story,
      but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a mile
      of the demolished castle of Torquilstone. Here Locksley assumed his seat&mdash;a
      throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge oak, and the
      silvan followers were gathered around him. He assigned to the Black Knight
      a seat at his right hand, and to Cedric a place upon his left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon my freedom, noble sirs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but in these glades I am
      monarch&mdash;they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjects would reck
      but little of my power, were I, within my own dominions, to yield place to
      mortal man.&mdash;Now, sirs, who hath seen our chaplain? where is our
      curtal Friar? A mass amongst Christian men best begins a busy morning.&rdquo;&mdash;No
      one had seen the Clerk of Copmanhurst. &ldquo;Over gods forbode!&rdquo; said the
      outlaw chief, &ldquo;I trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the wine-pot a
      thought too late. Who saw him since the castle was ta'en?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; quoth the Miller, &ldquo;marked him busy about the door of a cellar,
      swearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smack of
      Front-de-Boeuf's Gascoigne wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, the saints, as many as there be of them,&rdquo; said the Captain,
      &ldquo;forefend, lest he has drunk too deep of the wine-butts, and perished by
      the fall of the castle!&mdash;Away, Miller!&mdash;take with you enow of
      men, seek the place where you last saw him&mdash;throw water from the moat
      on the scorching ruins&mdash;I will have them removed stone by stone ere I
      lose my curtal Friar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an
      interesting division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much the
      troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, let us proceed,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;for when this bold deed shall
      be sounded abroad, the bands of De Bracy, of Malvoisin, and other allies
      of Front-de-Boeuf, will be in motion against us, and it were well for our
      safety that we retreat from the vicinity.&mdash;Noble Cedric,&rdquo; he said,
      turning to the Saxon, &ldquo;that spoil is divided into two portions; do thou
      make choice of that which best suits thee, to recompense thy people who
      were partakers with us in this adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good yeoman,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;my heart is oppressed with sadness. The noble
      Athelstane of Coningsburgh is no more&mdash;the last sprout of the sainted
      Confessor! Hopes have perished with him which can never return!&mdash;A
      sparkle hath been quenched by his blood, which no human breath can again
      rekindle! My people, save the few who are now with me, do but tarry my
      presence to transport his honoured remains to their last mansion. The Lady
      Rowena is desirous to return to Rotherwood, and must be escorted by a
      sufficient force. I should, therefore, ere now, have left this place; and
      I waited&mdash;not to share the booty, for, so help me God and Saint
      Withold! as neither I nor any of mine will touch the value of a liard,&mdash;I
      waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold yeomen, for the
      life and honour ye have saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the chief Outlaw, &ldquo;we did but half the work at most&mdash;take
      of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and followers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,&rdquo; answered Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And some,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;have been wise enough to reward themselves; they
      do not march off empty-handed altogether. We do not all wear motley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are welcome,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;our laws bind none but ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, thou, my poor knave,&rdquo; said Cedric, turning about and embracing his
      Jester, &ldquo;how shall I reward thee, who feared not to give thy body to
      chains and death instead of mine!&mdash;All forsook me, when the poor fool
      was faithful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tear stood in the eye of the rough Thane as he spoke&mdash;a mark of
      feeling which even the death of Athelstane had not extracted; but there
      was something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that waked
      his nature more keenly than even grief itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Jester, extricating himself from master's caress, &ldquo;if you
      pay my service with the water of your eye, the Jester must weep for
      company, and then what becomes of his vocation?&mdash;But, uncle, if you
      would indeed pleasure me, I pray you to pardon my playfellow Gurth, who
      stole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon him!&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric; &ldquo;I will both pardon and reward him.&mdash;Kneel
      down, Gurth.&rdquo;&mdash;The swineherd was in an instant at his master's feet&mdash;&ldquo;THEOW
      and ESNE <a href="#linknote-40" name="linknoteref-40" id="linknoteref-40"><small>40</small></a>
      art thou no longer,&rdquo; said Cedric touching him with a wand; &ldquo;FOLKFREE and
      SACLESS <a href="#linknote-41" name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41"><small>41</small></a>
      art thou in town and from town, in the forest as in the field. A hide of
      land I give to thee in my steads of Walbrugham, from me and mine to thee
      and thine aye and for ever; and God's malison on his head who this
      gainsays!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, Gurth sprung upon his
      feet, and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground. &ldquo;A
      smith and a file,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to do away the collar from the neck of a
      freeman!&mdash;Noble master! doubled is my strength by your gift, and
      doubly will I fight for you!&mdash;There is a free spirit in my breast&mdash;I
      am a man changed to myself and all around.&mdash;Ha, Fangs!&rdquo; he continued,&mdash;for
      that faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump upon
      him, to express his sympathy,&mdash;&ldquo;knowest thou thy master still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;Fangs and I still know thee, Gurth, though we must
      needs abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forget both us
      and thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall forget myself indeed ere I forget thee, true comrade,&rdquo; said
      Gurth; &ldquo;and were freedom fit for thee, Wamba, the master would not let
      thee want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;never think I envy thee, brother Gurth; the serf sits
      by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of battle&mdash;And
      what saith Oldhelm of Malmsbury&mdash;Better a fool at a feast than a wise
      man at a fray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tramp of horses was now heard, and the Lady Rowena appeared,
      surrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who
      joyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her
      freedom. She herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut
      palfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an unwonted
      degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone. Her lovely
      brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope for the future,
      as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past deliverance&mdash;She
      knew that Ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that Athelstane was dead. The
      former assurance filled her with the most sincere delight; and if she did
      not absolutely rejoice at the latter, she might be pardoned for feeling
      the full advantage of being freed from further persecution on the only
      subject in which she had ever been contradicted by her guardian Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Rowena bent her steed towards Locksley's seat, that bold yeoman, with
      all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general instinct of
      courtesy. The blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously waving her hand,
      and bending so low that her beautiful and loose tresses were for an
      instant mixed with the flowing mane of her palfrey, she expressed in few
      but apt words her obligations and her gratitude to Locksley and her other
      deliverers.&mdash;&ldquo;God bless you, brave men,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;God and Our
      Lady bless you and requite you for gallantly perilling yourselves in the
      cause of the oppressed!&mdash;If any of you should hunger, remember Rowena
      has food&mdash;if you should thirst, she has many a butt of wine and brown
      ale&mdash;and if the Normans drive ye from these walks, Rowena has forests
      of her own, where her gallant deliverers may range at full freedom, and
      never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, gentle lady,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;thanks from my company and myself.
      But, to have saved you requites itself. We who walk the greenwood do many
      a wild deed, and the Lady Rowena's deliverance may be received as an
      atonement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again bowing from her palfrey, Rowena turned to depart; but pausing a
      moment, while Cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave,
      she found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner De Bracy. He stood
      under a tree in deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast, and
      Rowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved. He looked up, however,
      and, when aware of her presence, a deep flush of shame suffused his
      handsome countenance. He stood a moment most irresolute; then, stepping
      forward, took her palfrey by the rein, and bent his knee before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the Lady Rowena deign to cast an eye&mdash;on a captive knight&mdash;on
      a dishonoured soldier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered Rowena, &ldquo;in enterprises such as yours, the real
      dishonour lies not in failure, but in success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conquest, lady, should soften the heart,&rdquo; answered De Bracy; &ldquo;let me but
      know that the Lady Rowena forgives the violence occasioned by an ill-fated
      passion, and she shall soon learn that De Bracy knows how to serve her in
      nobler ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;as a Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;that she does not forgive him at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has
      occasioned,&rdquo; continued Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unloose your hold on the lady's rein,&rdquo; said Cedric, coming up. &ldquo;By the
      bright sun above us, but it were shame, I would pin thee to the earth with
      my javelin&mdash;but be well assured, thou shalt smart, Maurice de Bracy,
      for thy share in this foul deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He threatens safely who threatens a prisoner,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;but when
      had a Saxon any touch of courtesy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then retiring two steps backward, he permitted the lady to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cedric, ere they departed, expressed his peculiar gratitude to the Black
      Champion, and earnestly entreated him to accompany him to Rotherwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that ye errant knights desire to carry your fortunes
      on the point of your lance, and reck not of land or goods; but war is a
      changeful mistress, and a home is sometimes desirable even to the champion
      whose trade is wandering. Thou hast earned one in the halls of Rotherwood,
      noble knight. Cedric has wealth enough to repair the injuries of fortune,
      and all he has is his deliverer's&mdash;Come, therefore, to Rotherwood,
      not as a guest, but as a son or brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cedric has already made me rich,&rdquo; said the Knight,&mdash;&ldquo;he has taught
      me the value of Saxon virtue. To Rotherwood will I come, brave Saxon, and
      that speedily; but, as now, pressing matters of moment detain me from your
      halls. Peradventure when I come hither, I will ask such a boon as will put
      even thy generosity to the test.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is granted ere spoken out,&rdquo; said Cedric, striking his ready hand into
      the gauntleted palm of the Black Knight,&mdash;&ldquo;it is granted already,
      were it to affect half my fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gage not thy promise so lightly,&rdquo; said the Knight of the Fetterlock; &ldquo;yet
      well I hope to gain the boon I shall ask. Meanwhile, adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have but to say,&rdquo; added the Saxon, &ldquo;that, during the funeral rites of
      the noble Athelstane, I shall be an inhabitant of the halls of his castle
      of Coningsburgh&mdash;They will be open to all who choose to partake of
      the funeral banqueting; and, I speak in name of the noble Edith, mother of
      the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who laboured so
      bravely, though unsuccessfully, to save Athelstane from Norman chains and
      Norman steel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master, &ldquo;rare
      feeding there will be&mdash;pity that the noble Athelstane cannot banquet
      at his own funeral.&mdash;But he,&rdquo; continued the Jester, lifting up his
      eyes gravely, &ldquo;is supping in Paradise, and doubtless does honour to the
      cheer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, and move on,&rdquo; said Cedric, his anger at this untimely jest being
      checked by the recollection of Wamba's recent services. Rowena waved a
      graceful adieu to him of the Fetterlock&mdash;the Saxon bade God speed
      him, and on they moved through a wide glade of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had scarce departed, ere a sudden procession moved from under the
      greenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre, and took
      the same direction with Rowena and her followers. The priests of a
      neighbouring convent, in expectation of the ample donation, or
      &ldquo;soul-scat&rdquo;, which Cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which the
      body of Athelstane was laid, and sang hymns as it was sadly and slowly
      borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of Coningsburgh, to be
      there deposited in the grave of Hengist, from whom the deceased derived
      his long descent. Many of his vassals had assembled at the news of his
      death, and followed the bier with all the external marks, at least, of
      dejection and sorrow. Again the outlaws arose, and paid the same rude and
      spontaneous homage to death, which they had so lately rendered to beauty&mdash;the
      slow chant and mournful step of the priests brought back to their
      remembrance such of their comrades as had fallen in the yesterday's array.
      But such recollections dwell not long with those who lead a life of danger
      and enterprise, and ere the sound of the death-hymn had died on the wind,
      the outlaws were again busied in the distribution of their spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valiant knight,&rdquo; said Locksley to the Black Champion, &ldquo;without whose good
      heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed, will it
      please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best serve to
      pleasure you, and to remind you of this my Trysting-tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the offer,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;as frankly as it is given; and I
      ask permission to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my own pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is thine already,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;and well for him! else the tyrant
      had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of his
      Free-Companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around him.&mdash;But
      he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slain my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Bracy,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;thou art free&mdash;depart. He whose
      prisoner thou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. But beware
      of the future, lest a worse thing befall thee.&mdash;Maurice de Bracy, I
      say BEWARE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the
      yeomen burst at once into a shout of execration and derision. The proud
      knight instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his form
      to its full height, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Peace, ye yelping curs! who open upon
      a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bay&mdash;De Bracy scorns
      your censure as he would disdain your applause. To your brakes and caves,
      ye outlawed thieves! and be silent when aught knightly or noble is but
      spoken within a league of your fox-earths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This ill-timed defiance might have procured for De Bracy a volley of
      arrows, but for the hasty and imperative interference of the outlaw Chief.
      Meanwhile the knight caught a horse by the rein, for several which had
      been taken in the stables of Front-de-Boeuf stood accoutred around, and
      were a valuable part of the booty. He threw himself upon the saddle, and
      galloped off through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed, the
      chief Outlaw took from his neck the rich horn and baldric which he had
      recently gained at the strife of archery near Ashby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble knight.&rdquo; he said to him of the Fetterlock, &ldquo;if you disdain not to
      grace by your acceptance a bugle which an English yeoman has once worn,
      this I will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant bearing&mdash;and
      if ye have aught to do, and, as happeneth oft to a gallant knight, ye
      chance to be hard bested in any forest between Trent and Tees, wind three
      mots <a href="#linknote-42" name="linknoteref-42" id="linknoteref-42"><small>42</small></a>
      upon the horn thus, 'Wa-sa-hoa!' and it may well chance ye shall find
      helpers and rescue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then gave breath to the bugle, and winded once and again the call which
      he described, until the knight had caught the notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gramercy for the gift, bold yeoman,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;and better help
      than thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost need.&rdquo;
       And then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well blown and clearly,&rdquo; said the yeoman; &ldquo;beshrew me an thou knowest not
      as much of woodcraft as of war!&mdash;thou hast been a striker of deer in
      thy day, I warrant.&mdash;Comrades, mark these three mots&mdash;it is the
      call of the Knight of the Fetterlock; and he who hears it, and hastens not
      to serve him at his need, I will have him scourged out of our band with
      his own bowstring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live our leader!&rdquo; shouted the yeomen, &ldquo;and long live the Black
      Knight of the Fetterlock!&mdash;May he soon use our service, to prove how
      readily it will be paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Locksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he
      performed with the most laudable impartiality. A tenth part of the whole
      was set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next
      allotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned to the widows
      and children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in masses for the
      souls of such as had left no surviving family. The rest was divided
      amongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and the judgment
      of the Chief, on all such doubtful questions as occurred, was delivered
      with great shrewdness, and received with absolute submission. The Black
      Knight was not a little surprised to find that men, in a state so lawless,
      were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably governed,
      and all that he observed added to his opinion of the justice and judgment
      of their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      When each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the
      treasurer, accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transporting that
      belonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security, the
      portion devoted to the church still remained unappropriated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the leader, &ldquo;we could hear tidings of our joyous chaplain&mdash;he
      was never wont to be absent when meat was to be blessed, or spoil to be
      parted; and it is his duty to take care of these the tithes of our
      successful enterprise. It may be the office has helped to cover some of
      his canonical irregularities. Also, I have a holy brother of his a
      prisoner at no great distance, and I would fain have the Friar to help me
      to deal with him in due sort&mdash;I greatly misdoubt the safety of the
      bluff priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I were right sorry for that,&rdquo; said the Knight of the Fetterlock, &ldquo;for I
      stand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merry night in his
      cell. Let us to the ruins of the castle; it may be we shall there learn
      some tidings of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they thus spoke, a loud shout among the yeomen announced the arrival
      of him for whom they feared, as they learned from the stentorian voice of
      the Friar himself, long before they saw his burly person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make room, my merry-men!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;room for your godly father and
      his prisoner&mdash;Cry welcome once more.&mdash;I come, noble leader, like
      an eagle with my prey in my clutch.&rdquo;&mdash;And making his way through the
      ring, amidst the laughter of all around, he appeared in majestic triumph,
      his huge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one end of which
      was fastened to the neck of the unfortunate Isaac of York, who, bent down
      by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who shouted
      aloud, &ldquo;Where is Allan-a-Dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or if it were
      but a lay?&mdash;By Saint Hermangild, the jingling crowder is ever out of
      the way where there is an apt theme for exalting valour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curtal Priest,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;thou hast been at a wet mass this
      morning, as early as it is. In the name of Saint Nicholas, whom hast thou
      got here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A captive to my sword and to my lance, noble Captain,&rdquo; replied the Clerk
      of Copmanhurst; &ldquo;to my bow and to my halberd, I should rather say; and yet
      I have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity. Speak, Jew&mdash;have
      I not ransomed thee from Sathanas?&mdash;have I not taught thee thy
      'credo', thy 'pater', and thine 'Ave Maria'?&mdash;Did I not spend the
      whole night in drinking to thee, and in expounding of mysteries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of God!&rdquo; ejaculated the poor Jew, &ldquo;will no one take me out
      of the keeping of this mad&mdash;I mean this holy man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's this, Jew?&rdquo; said the Friar, with a menacing aspect; &ldquo;dost thou
      recant, Jew?&mdash;Bethink thee, if thou dost relapse into thine
      infidelity, though thou are not so tender as a suckling pig&mdash;I would
      I had one to break my fast upon&mdash;thou art not too tough to be
      roasted! Be conformable, Isaac, and repeat the words after me. 'Ave
      Maria'!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, we will have no profanation, mad Priest,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;let us
      rather hear where you found this prisoner of thine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Dunstan,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;I found him where I sought for better
      ware! I did step into the cellarage to see what might be rescued there;
      for though a cup of burnt wine, with spice, be an evening's drought for an
      emperor, it were waste, methought, to let so much good liquor be mulled at
      once; and I had caught up one runlet of sack, and was coming to call more
      aid among these lazy knaves, who are ever to seek when a good deed is to
      be done, when I was avised of a strong door&mdash;Aha! thought I, here is
      the choicest juice of all in this secret crypt; and the knave butler,
      being disturbed in his vocation, hath left the key in the door&mdash;In
      therefore I went, and found just nought besides a commodity of rusted
      chains and this dog of a Jew, who presently rendered himself my prisoner,
      rescue or no rescue. I did but refresh myself after the fatigue of the
      action, with the unbeliever, with one humming cup of sack, and was
      proceeding to lead forth my captive, when, crash after crash, as with wild
      thunder-dint and levin-fire, down toppled the masonry of an outer tower,
      (marry beshrew their hands that built it not the firmer!) and blocked up
      the passage. The roar of one falling tower followed another&mdash;I gave
      up thought of life; and deeming it a dishonour to one of my profession to
      pass out of this world in company with a Jew, I heaved up my halberd to
      beat his brains out; but I took pity on his grey hairs, and judged it
      better to lay down the partisan, and take up my spiritual weapon for his
      conversion. And truly, by the blessing of Saint Dunstan, the seed has been
      sown in good soil; only that, with speaking to him of mysteries through
      the whole night, and being in a manner fasting, (for the few droughts of
      sack which I sharpened my wits with were not worth marking,) my head is
      well-nigh dizzied, I trow.&mdash;But I was clean exhausted.&mdash;Gilbert
      and Wibbald know in what state they found me&mdash;quite and clean
      exhausted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can bear witness,&rdquo; said Gilbert; &ldquo;for when we had cleared away the
      ruin, and by Saint Dunstan's help lighted upon the dungeon stair, we found
      the runlet of sack half empty, the Jew half dead, and the Friar more than
      half&mdash;exhausted, as he calls it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye be knaves! ye lie!&rdquo; retorted the offended Friar; &ldquo;it was you and your
      gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, and called it your morning
      draught&mdash;I am a pagan, an I kept it not for the Captain's own throat.
      But what recks it? The Jew is converted, and understands all I have told
      him, very nearly, if not altogether, as well as myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jew,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;is this true? hast thou renounced thine
      unbelief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I so find mercy in your eyes,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;as I know not one word
      which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearful night. Alas! I was
      so distraught with agony, and fear, and grief, that had our holy father
      Abraham come to preach to me, he had found but a deaf listener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou liest, Jew, and thou knowest thou dost.&rdquo; said the Friar; &ldquo;I will
      remind thee of but one word of our conference&mdash;thou didst promise to
      give all thy substance to our holy Order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me the Promise, fair sirs,&rdquo; said Isaac, even more alarmed than
      before, &ldquo;as no such sounds ever crossed my lips! Alas! I am an aged
      beggar'd man&mdash;I fear me a childless&mdash;have ruth on me, and let me
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;if thou dost retract vows made in favour of holy
      Church, thou must do penance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of it
      lustily on the Jew's shoulders, had not the Black Knight stopped the blow,
      and thereby transferred the Holy Clerk's resentment to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Thomas of Kent,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an I buckle to my gear, I will teach
      thee, sir lazy lover, to mell with thine own matters, maugre thine iron
      case there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, be not wroth with me,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;thou knowest I am thy sworn
      friend and comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no such thing,&rdquo; answered the Friar; &ldquo;and defy thee for a meddling
      coxcomb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the Knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking
      his quondam host, &ldquo;hast thou forgotten how, that for my sake (for I say
      nothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty) thou didst break
      thy vow of fast and vigil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, friend,&rdquo; said the Friar, clenching his huge fist, &ldquo;I will bestow a
      buffet on thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept of no such presents,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;I am content to take thy
      cuff <a href="#linknote-421" name="linknoteref-421" id="linknoteref-421"><small>421</small></a>
      as a loan, but I will repay thee with usury as deep as ever thy prisoner
      there exacted in his traffic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will prove that presently,&rdquo; said the Friar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hola!&rdquo; cried the Captain, &ldquo;what art thou after, mad Friar? brawling
      beneath our Trysting-tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No brawling,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;it is but a friendly interchange of
      courtesy.&mdash;Friar, strike an thou darest&mdash;I will stand thy blow,
      if thou wilt stand mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,&rdquo; said the
      churchman; &ldquo;but have at thee&mdash;Down thou goest, an thou wert Goliath
      of Gath in his brazen helmet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full
      strength to the blow, gave the Knight a buffet that might have felled an
      ox. But his adversary stood firm as a rock. A loud shout was uttered by
      all the yeomen around; for the Clerk's cuff was proverbial amongst them,
      and there were few who, in jest or earnest, had not had the occasion to
      know its vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Priest,&rdquo; said, the Knight, pulling off his gauntlet, &ldquo;if I had
      vantage on my head, I will have none on my hand&mdash;stand fast as a true
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Genam meam dedi vapulatori'&mdash;I have given my cheek to the smiter,&rdquo;
       said the Priest; &ldquo;an thou canst stir me from the spot, fellow, I will
      freely bestow on thee the Jew's ransom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke the burly Priest, assuming, on his part, high defiance. But who
      may resist his fate? The buffet of the Knight was given with such strength
      and good-will, that the Friar rolled head over heels upon the plain, to
      the great amazement of all the spectators. But he arose neither angry nor
      crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said he to the Knight, &ldquo;thou shouldst have used thy strength
      with more discretion. I had mumbled but a lame mass an thou hadst broken
      my jaw, for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops. Nevertheless,
      there is my hand, in friendly witness, that I will exchange no more cuffs
      with thee, having been a loser by the barter. End now all unkindness. Let
      us put the Jew to ransom, since the leopard will not change his spots, and
      a Jew he will continue to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Priest,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;is not half so confident of the Jew's
      conversion, since he received that buffet on the ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to, knave, what pratest thou of conversions?&mdash;what, is there no
      respect?&mdash;all masters and no men?&mdash;I tell thee, fellow, I was
      somewhat totty when I received the good knight's blow, or I had kept my
      ground under it. But an thou gibest more of it, thou shalt learn I can
      give as well as take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace all!&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;And thou, Jew, think of thy ransom; thou
      needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursed in all
      Christian communities, and trust me that we cannot endure thy presence
      among us. Think, therefore, of an offer, while I examine a prisoner of
      another cast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were many of Front-de-Boeuf's men taken?&rdquo; demanded the Black Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of note enough to be put to ransom,&rdquo; answered the Captain; &ldquo;a set of
      hilding fellows there were, whom we dismissed to find them a new master&mdash;enough
      had been done for revenge and profit; the bunch of them were not worth a
      cardecu. The prisoner I speak of is better booty&mdash;a jolly monk riding
      to visit his leman, an I may judge by his horse-gear and wearing apparel.&mdash;Here
      cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a pyet.&rdquo; And, between two yeomen,
      was brought before the silvan throne of the outlaw Chief, our old friend,
      Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx.

      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &mdash;-Flower of warriors,
     How is't with Titus Lartius?
     MARCIUS.&mdash;As with a man busied about decrees,
     Condemning some to death and some to exile,
     Ransoming him or pitying, threatening the other.
     &mdash;Coriolanus
</pre>
    <p>
      The captive Abbot's features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture of
      offended pride, and deranged foppery and bodily terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how now, my masters?&rdquo; said he, with a voice in which all three
      emotions were blended. &ldquo;What order is this among ye? Be ye Turks or
      Christians, that handle a churchman?&mdash;Know ye what it is, 'manus
      imponere in servos Domini'? Ye have plundered my mails&mdash;torn my cope
      of curious cut lace, which might have served a cardinal!&mdash;Another in
      my place would have been at his 'excommunicabo vos'; but I am placible,
      and if ye order forth my palfreys, release my brethren, and restore my
      mails, tell down with all speed an hundred crowns to be expended in masses
      at the high altar of Jorvaulx Abbey, and make your vow to eat no venison
      until next Pentecost, it may be you shall hear little more of this mad
      frolic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Father,&rdquo; said the chief Outlaw, &ldquo;it grieves me to think that you
      have met with such usage from any of my followers, as calls for your
      fatherly reprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usage!&rdquo; echoed the priest, encouraged by the mild tone of the silvan
      leader; &ldquo;it were usage fit for no hound of good race&mdash;much less for a
      Christian&mdash;far less for a priest&mdash;and least of all for the Prior
      of the holy community of Jorvaulx. Here is a profane and drunken minstrel,
      called Allan-a-Dale&mdash;'nebulo quidam'&mdash;who has menaced me with
      corporal punishment&mdash;nay, with death itself, an I pay not down four
      hundred crowns of ransom, to the boot of all the treasure he hath already
      robbed me of&mdash;gold chains and gymmal rings to an unknown value;
      besides what is broken and spoiled among their rude hands, such as my
      pouncer-box and silver crisping-tongs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible that Allan-a-Dale can have thus treated a man of your
      reverend bearing,&rdquo; replied the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true as the gospel of Saint Nicodemus,&rdquo; said the Prior; &ldquo;he swore,
      with many a cruel north-country oath, that he would hang me up on the
      highest tree in the greenwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he so in very deed? Nay, then, reverend father, I think you had
      better comply with his demands&mdash;for Allan-a-Dale is the very man to
      abide by his word when he has so pledged it.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-43"      name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43"><small>43</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do but jest with me,&rdquo; said the astounded Prior, with a forced laugh;
      &ldquo;and I love a good jest with all my heart. But, ha! ha! ha! when the mirth
      has lasted the livelong night, it is time to be grave in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am as grave as a father confessor,&rdquo; replied the Outlaw; &ldquo;you must
      pay a round ransom, Sir Prior, or your convent is likely to be called to a
      new election; for your place will know you no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye Christians,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;and hold this language to a
      churchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christians! ay, marry are we, and have divinity among us to boot,&rdquo;
       answered the Outlaw. &ldquo;Let our buxom chaplain stand forth, and expound to
      this reverend father the texts which concern this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Friar, half-drunk, half-sober, had huddled a friar's frock over his
      green cassock, and now summoning together whatever scraps of learning he
      had acquired by rote in former days, &ldquo;Holy father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;'Deus faciat
      salvam benignitatem vestram'&mdash;You are welcome to the greenwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What profane mummery is this?&rdquo; said the Prior. &ldquo;Friend, if thou be'st
      indeed of the church, it were a better deed to show me how I may escape
      from these men's hands, than to stand ducking and grinning here like a
      morris-dancer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, reverend father,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;I know but one mode in which
      thou mayst escape. This is Saint Andrew's day with us, we are taking our
      tithes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not of the church, then, I trust, my good brother?&rdquo; said the Prior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of church and lay,&rdquo; said the Friar; &ldquo;and therefore, Sir Prior 'facite
      vobis amicos de Mammone iniquitatis'&mdash;make yourselves friends of the
      Mammon of unrighteousness, for no other friendship is like to serve your
      turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love a jolly woodsman at heart,&rdquo; said the Prior, softening his tone;
      &ldquo;come, ye must not deal too hard with me&mdash;I can well of woodcraft,
      and can wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak rings
      again&mdash;Come, ye must not deal too hard with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him a horn,&rdquo; said the Outlaw; &ldquo;we will prove the skill he boasts
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prior Aymer winded a blast accordingly. The Captain shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Prior,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou blowest a merry note, but it may not ransom
      thee&mdash;we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knight's shield hath
      it, to set thee free for a blast. Moreover, I have found thee&mdash;thou
      art one of those, who, with new French graces and Tra-li-ras, disturb the
      ancient English bugle notes.&mdash;Prior, that last flourish on the
      recheat hath added fifty crowns to thy ransom, for corrupting the true old
      manly blasts of venerie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, friend,&rdquo; said the Abbot, peevishly, &ldquo;thou art ill to please with
      thy woodcraft. I pray thee be more conformable in this matter of my
      ransom. At a word&mdash;since I must needs, for once, hold a candle to the
      devil&mdash;what ransom am I to pay for walking on Watling-street, without
      having fifty men at my back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it not well,&rdquo; said the Lieutenant of the gang apart to the Captain,
      &ldquo;that the Prior should name the Jew's ransom, and the Jew name the
      Prior's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a mad knave,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;but thy plan transcends!&mdash;Here,
      Jew, step forth&mdash;Look at that holy Father Aymer, Prior of the rich
      Abbey of Jorvaulx, and tell us at what ransom we should hold him?&mdash;Thou
      knowest the income of his convent, I warrant thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, assuredly,&rdquo; said Isaac. &ldquo;I have trafficked with the good fathers, and
      bought wheat and barley, and fruits of the earth, and also much wool. O,
      it is a rich abbey-stede, and they do live upon the fat, and drink the
      sweet wines upon the lees, these good fathers of Jorvaulx. Ah, if an
      outcast like me had such a home to go to, and such incomings by the year
      and by the month, I would pay much gold and silver to redeem my
      captivity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hound of a Jew!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prior, &ldquo;no one knows better than thy own
      cursed self, that our holy house of God is indebted for the finishing of
      our chancel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due
      allowance of Gascon wine,&rdquo; interrupted the Jew; &ldquo;but that&mdash;that is
      small matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear the infidel dog!&rdquo; said the churchman; &ldquo;he jangles as if our holy
      community did come under debts for the wines we have a license to drink,
      'propter necessitatem, et ad frigus depellendum'. The circumcised villain
      blasphemeth the holy church, and Christian men listen and rebuke him not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this helps nothing,&rdquo; said the leader.&mdash;&ldquo;Isaac, pronounce what he
      may pay, without flaying both hide and hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An six hundred crowns,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;the good Prior might well pay to
      your honoured valours, and never sit less soft in his stall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six hundred crowns,&rdquo; said the leader, gravely; &ldquo;I am contented&mdash;thou
      hast well spoken, Isaac&mdash;six hundred crowns.&mdash;It is a sentence,
      Sir Prior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sentence!&mdash;a sentence!&rdquo; exclaimed the band; &ldquo;Solomon had not done
      it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hearest thy doom, Prior,&rdquo; said the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye are mad, my masters,&rdquo; said the Prior; &ldquo;where am I to find such a sum?
      If I sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar at Jorvaulx, I shall
      scarce raise the half; and it will be necessary for that purpose that I go
      to Jorvaulx myself; ye may retain as borrows <a href="#linknote-44"      name="linknoteref-44" id="linknoteref-44"><small>44</small></a> my two
      priests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be but blind trust,&rdquo; said the Outlaw; &ldquo;we will retain thee,
      Prior, and send them to fetch thy ransom. Thou shalt not want a cup of
      wine and a collop of venison the while; and if thou lovest woodcraft, thou
      shalt see such as your north country never witnessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, if so please you,&rdquo; said Isaac, willing to curry favour with the
      outlaws, &ldquo;I can send to York for the six hundred crowns, out of certain
      monies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend Prior present will
      grant me a quittance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, Isaac,&rdquo; said the Captain;
      &ldquo;and thou shalt lay down the redemption money for Prior Aymer as well as
      for thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself! ah, courageous sirs,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;I am a broken and
      impoverished man; a beggar's staff must be my portion through life,
      supposing I were to pay you fifty crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prior shall judge of that matter,&rdquo; replied the Captain.&mdash;&ldquo;How
      say you, Father Aymer? Can the Jew afford a good ransom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he afford a ransom?&rdquo; answered the Prior &ldquo;Is he not Isaac of York,
      rich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of Israel, who were
      led into Assyrian bondage?&mdash;I have seen but little of him myself, but
      our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him, and report says
      that his house at York is so full of gold and silver as is a shame in any
      Christian land. Marvel it is to all living Christian hearts that such
      gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the state, and
      even of the holy church herself, with foul usuries and extortions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, father,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;mitigate and assuage your choler. I pray of
      your reverence to remember that I force my monies upon no one. But when
      churchman and layman, prince and prior, knight and priest, come knocking
      to Isaac's door, they borrow not his shekels with these uncivil terms. It
      is then, Friend Isaac, will you pleasure us in this matter, and our day
      shall be truly kept, so God sa' me?&mdash;and Kind Isaac, if ever you
      served man, show yourself a friend in this need! And when the day comes,
      and I ask my own, then what hear I but Damned Jew, and The curse of Egypt
      on your tribe, and all that may stir up the rude and uncivil populace
      against poor strangers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prior,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;Jew though he be, he hath in this spoken well.
      Do thou, therefore, name his ransom, as he named thine, without farther
      rude terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None but 'latro famosus'&mdash;the interpretation whereof,&rdquo; said the
      Prior, &ldquo;will I give at some other time and tide&mdash;would place a
      Christian prelate and an unbaptized Jew upon the same bench. But since ye
      require me to put a price upon this caitiff, I tell you openly that ye
      will wrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a thousand
      crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sentence!&mdash;a sentence!&rdquo; exclaimed the chief Outlaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sentence!&mdash;a sentence!&rdquo; shouted his assessors; &ldquo;the Christian has
      shown his good nurture, and dealt with us more generously than the Jew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The God of my fathers help me!&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;will ye bear to the ground
      an impoverished creature?&mdash;I am this day childless, and will ye
      deprive me of the means of livelihood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wilt have the less to provide for, Jew, if thou art childless,&rdquo; said
      Aymer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my lord,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;your law permits you not to know how the
      child of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our heart&mdash;O
      Rebecca! laughter of my beloved Rachel! were each leaf on that tree a
      zecchin, and each zecchin mine own, all that mass of wealth would I give
      to know whether thou art alive, and escaped the hands of the Nazarene!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not thy daughter dark-haired?&rdquo; said one of the outlaws; &ldquo;and wore she
      not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did!&mdash;she did!&rdquo; said the old man, trembling with eagerness, as
      formerly with fear. &ldquo;The blessing of Jacob be upon thee! canst thou tell
      me aught of her safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was she, then,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;who was carried off by the proud
      Templar, when he broke through our ranks on yester-even. I had drawn my
      bow to send a shaft after him, but spared him even for the sake of the
      damsel, who I feared might take harm from the arrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; answered the Jew, &ldquo;I would to God thou hadst shot, though the arrow
      had pierced her bosom!&mdash;Better the tomb of her fathers than the
      dishonourable couch of the licentious and savage Templar. Ichabod!
      Ichabod! the glory hath departed from my house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; said the Chief, looking round, &ldquo;the old man is but a Jew,
      natheless his grief touches me.&mdash;Deal uprightly with us, Isaac&mdash;will
      paying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether penniless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac, recalled to think of his worldly goods, the love of which, by dint
      of inveterate habit, contended even with his parental affection, grew
      pale, stammered, and could not deny there might be some small surplus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;go to&mdash;what though there be,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;we will
      not reckon with thee too closely. Without treasure thou mayst as well hope
      to redeem thy child from the clutches of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as to
      shoot a stag-royal with a headless shaft.&mdash;We will take thee at the
      same ransom with Prior Aymer, or rather at one hundred crowns lower, which
      hundred crowns shall be mine own peculiar loss, and not light upon this
      worshipful community; and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of rating
      a Jew merchant as high as a Christian prelate, and thou wilt have six
      hundred crowns remaining to treat for thy daughter's ransom. Templars love
      the glitter of silver shekels as well as the sparkle of black eyes.&mdash;Hasten
      to make thy crowns chink in the ear of De Bois-Guilbert, ere worse comes
      of it. Thou wilt find him, as our scouts have brought notice, at the next
      Preceptory house of his Order.&mdash;Said I well, my merry mates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leader's opinion;
      and Isaac, relieved of one half of his apprehensions, by learning that his
      daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw himself at the feet
      of the generous Outlaw, and, rubbing his beard against his buskins, sought
      to kiss the hem of his green cassock. The Captain drew himself back, and
      extricated himself from the Jew's grasp, not without some marks of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! I am English born, and love no such
      Eastern prostrations&mdash;Kneel to God, and not to a poor sinner, like
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Jew,&rdquo; said Prior Aymer; &ldquo;kneel to God, as represented in the servant
      of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and due gifts to
      the shrine of Saint Robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for thyself and
      thy daughter Rebecca? I grieve for the maiden, for she is of fair and
      comely countenance,&mdash;I beheld her in the lists of Ashby. Also Brian
      de Bois-Guilbert is one with whom I may do much&mdash;bethink thee how
      thou mayst deserve my good word with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;on every hand the spoilers arise against me&mdash;I
      am given as a prey unto the Assyrian, and a prey unto him of Egypt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?&rdquo; answered the
      Prior; &ldquo;for what saith holy writ, 'verbum Domini projecerunt, et sapientia
      est nulla in eis'&mdash;they have cast forth the word of the Lord, and
      there is no wisdom in them; 'propterea dabo mulieres eorum exteris'&mdash;I
      will give their women to strangers, that is to the Templar, as in the
      present matter; 'et thesauros eorum haeredibus alienis', and their
      treasures to others&mdash;as in the present case to these honest
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into
      his state of desolation and despair. But the leader of the yeomen led him
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advise thee well, Isaac,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;what thou wilt do in this
      matter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman. He is
      vain, Isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his
      profusion. Thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that I am
      blinded by thy pretexts of poverty. I am intimately acquainted, Isaac,
      with the very iron chest in which thou dost keep thy money-bags&mdash;What!
      know I not the great stone beneath the apple-tree, that leads into the
      vaulted chamber under thy garden at York?&rdquo; The Jew grew as pale as death&mdash;&ldquo;But
      fear nothing from me,&rdquo; continued the yeoman, &ldquo;for we are of old
      acquainted. Dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair daughter
      Rebecca redeemed from the gyves at York, and kept him in thy house till
      his health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him recovered, and with a
      piece of money?&mdash;Usurer as thou art, thou didst never place coin at
      better interest than that poor silver mark, for it has this day saved thee
      five hundred crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou art he whom we called Diccon Bend-the-Bow?&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;I
      thought ever I knew the accent of thy voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Bend-the-Bow,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;and Locksley, and have a good name
      besides all these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thou art mistaken, good Bend-the-Bow, concerning that same vaulted
      apartment. So help me Heaven, as there is nought in it but some
      merchandises which I will gladly part with to you&mdash;one hundred yards
      of Lincoln green to make doublets to thy men, and a hundred staves of
      Spanish yew to make bows, and a hundred silken bowstrings, tough, round,
      and sound&mdash;these will I send thee for thy good-will, honest Diccon,
      an thou wilt keep silence about the vault, my good Diccon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silent as a dormouse,&rdquo; said the Outlaw; &ldquo;and never trust me but I am
      grieved for thy daughter. But I may not help it&mdash;The Templars lances
      are too strong for my archery in the open field&mdash;they would scatter
      us like dust. Had I but known it was Rebecca when she was borne off,
      something might have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy.
      Come, shall I treat for thee with the Prior?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God's name, Diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of my
      bosom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,&rdquo; said the Outlaw,
      &ldquo;and I will deal with him in thy behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then turned from the Jew, who followed him, however, as closely as his
      shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prior Aymer,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;come apart with me under this tree. Men
      say thou dost love wine, and a lady's smile, better than beseems thy
      Order, Sir Priest; but with that I have nought to do. I have heard, too,
      thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse, and it may well be
      that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest not a purse
      of gold. But I have never heard that thou didst love oppression or
      cruelty.&mdash;Now, here is Isaac willing to give thee the means of
      pleasure and pastime in a bag containing one hundred marks of silver, if
      thy intercession with thine ally the Templar shall avail to procure the
      freedom of his daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In safety and honour, as when taken from me,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;otherwise it
      is no bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, Isaac,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;or I give up thine interest.&mdash;What
      say you to this my purpose, Prior Aymer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter,&rdquo; quoth the Prior, &ldquo;is of a mixed condition; for, if I do a
      good deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to the vantage of a
      Jew, and in so much is against my conscience. Yet, if the Israelite will
      advantage the Church by giving me somewhat over to the building of our
      dortour, <a href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45" id="linknoteref-45"><small>45</small></a>
      I will take it on my conscience to aid him in the matter of his daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a score of marks to the dortour,&rdquo; said the Outlaw,&mdash;&ldquo;Be still, I
      say, Isaac!&mdash;or for a brace of silver candlesticks to the altar, we
      will not stand with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but, good Diccon Bend-the-Bow&rdquo;&mdash;said Isaac, endeavouring to
      interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Jew&mdash;good beast&mdash;good earthworm!&rdquo; said the yeoman, losing
      patience; &ldquo;an thou dost go on to put thy filthy lucre in the balance with
      thy daughter's life and honour, by Heaven, I will strip thee of every
      maravedi thou hast in the world, before three days are out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac shrunk together, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what pledge am I to have for all this?&rdquo; said the Prior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Isaac returns successful through your mediation,&rdquo; said the Outlaw,
      &ldquo;I swear by Saint Hubert, I will see that he pays thee the money in good
      silver, or I will reckon with him for it in such sort, he had better have
      paid twenty such sums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, Jew,&rdquo; said Aymer, &ldquo;since I must needs meddle in this matter,
      let me have the use of thy writing-tablets&mdash;though, hold&mdash;rather
      than use thy pen, I would fast for twenty-four hours, and where shall I
      find one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your holy scruples can dispense with using the Jew's tablets, for the
      pen I can find a remedy,&rdquo; said the yeoman; and, bending his bow, he aimed
      his shaft at a wild-goose which was soaring over their heads, the
      advanced-guard of a phalanx of his tribe, which were winging their way to
      the distant and solitary fens of Holderness. The bird came fluttering
      down, transfixed with the arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Prior,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;are quills enow to supply all the monks
      of Jorvaulx for the next hundred years, an they take not to writing
      chronicles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prior sat down, and at great leisure indited an epistle to Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, and having carefully sealed up the tablets, delivered them
      to the Jew, saying, &ldquo;This will be thy safe-conduct to the Preceptory of
      Templestowe, and, as I think, is most likely to accomplish the delivery of
      thy daughter, if it be well backed with proffers of advantage and
      commodity at thine own hand; for, trust me well, the good Knight
      Bois-Guilbert is of their confraternity that do nought for nought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Prior,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;I will detain thee no longer here than to
      give the Jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns at which thy ransom is
      fixed&mdash;I accept of him for my pay-master; and if I hear that ye
      boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum so paid by him, Saint Mary
      refuse me, an I burn not the abbey over thine head, though I hang ten
      years the sooner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to
      Bois-Guilbert, the Prior wrote an acquittance, discharging Isaac of York
      of six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his
      ransom, and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Prior Aymer, &ldquo;I will pray you of restitution of my mules
      and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending upon me,
      and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which I have
      been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true
      prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touching your brethren, Sir Prior,&rdquo; said Locksley, &ldquo;they shall have
      present freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching your horses and
      mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may enable
      you to reach York, for it were cruel to deprive you of the means of
      journeying.&mdash;But as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else,
      you must understand that we are men of tender consciences, and will not
      yield to a venerable man like yourself, who should be dead to the vanities
      of this life, the strong temptation to break the rule of his foundation,
      by wearing rings, chains, or other vain gauds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what you do, my masters,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;ere you put your hand on
      the Church's patrimony&mdash;These things are 'inter res sacras', and I
      wot not what judgment might ensue were they to be handled by laical
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care of that, reverend Prior,&rdquo; said the Hermit of
      Copmanhurst; &ldquo;for I will wear them myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, or brother,&rdquo; said the Prior, in answer to this solution of his
      doubts, &ldquo;if thou hast really taken religious orders, I pray thee to look
      how thou wilt answer to thine official for the share thou hast taken in
      this day's work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Prior,&rdquo; returned the Hermit, &ldquo;you are to know that I belong to a
      little diocese, where I am my own diocesan, and care as little for the
      Bishop of York as I do for the Abbot of Jorvaulx, the Prior, and all the
      convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art utterly irregular,&rdquo; said the Prior; &ldquo;one of those disorderly
      men, who, taking on them the sacred character without due cause, profane
      the holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at their
      hands; 'lapides pro pane condonantes iis', giving them stones instead of
      bread as the Vulgate hath it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;an my brain-pan could have been broken by Latin,
      it had not held so long together.&mdash;I say, that easing a world of such
      misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks, is a
      lawful spoiling of the Egyptians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou be'st a hedge-priest,&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-46" name="linknoteref-46"       id="linknoteref-46"><small>46</small></a> said the Prior, in great wrath,
      &ldquo;'excommunicabo vos'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou be'st thyself more like a thief and a heretic,&rdquo; said the Friar,
      equally indignant; &ldquo;I will pouch up no such affront before my
      parishioners, as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me, although I be
      a reverend brother to thee. 'Ossa ejus perfringam', I will break your
      bones, as the Vulgate hath it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hola!&rdquo; cried the Captain, &ldquo;come the reverend brethren to such terms?&mdash;Keep
      thine assurance of peace, Friar.&mdash;Prior, an thou hast not made thy
      peace perfect with God, provoke the Friar no further.&mdash;Hermit, let
      the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomed man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their
      voices, vituperating each other in bad Latin, which the Prior delivered
      the more fluently, and the Hermit with the greater vehemence. The Prior at
      length recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was
      compromising his dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the
      Outlaw's chaplain, and being joined by his attendants, rode off with
      considerably less pomp, and in a much more apostolical condition, so far
      as worldly matters were concerned, than he had exhibited before this
      rencounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained that the Jew should produce some security for the ransom which
      he was to pay on the Prior's account, as well as upon his own. He gave,
      accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his tribe at
      York, requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand crowns, and
      to deliver certain merchandises specified in the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother Sheva,&rdquo; he said, groaning deeply, &ldquo;hath the key of my
      warehouses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of the vaulted chamber,&rdquo; whispered Locksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;may Heaven forefend!&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;evil is the hour that let
      any one whomsoever into that secret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is safe with me,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;so be that this thy scroll produce
      the sum therein nominated and set down.&mdash;But what now, Isaac? art
      dead? art stupefied? hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy
      daughter's peril out of thy mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jew started to his feet&mdash;&ldquo;No, Diccon, no&mdash;I will presently
      set forth.&mdash;Farewell, thou whom I may not call good, and dare not and
      will not call evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet ere Isaac departed, the Outlaw Chief bestowed on him this parting
      advice:&mdash;&ldquo;Be liberal of thine offers, Isaac, and spare not thy purse
      for thy daughter's safety. Credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in
      her cause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured
      molten down thy throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey,
      accompanied by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, and at the
      same time his guards, through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Knight, who had seen with no small interest these various
      proceedings, now took his leave of the Outlaw in turn; nor could he avoid
      expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil policy
      amongst persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and influence of
      the laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fruit, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the yeoman, &ldquo;will sometimes grow on a sorry
      tree; and evil times are not always productive of evil alone and unmixed.
      Amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there are, doubtless,
      numbers who wish to exercise its license with some moderation, and some
      who regret, it may be, that they are obliged to follow such a trade at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to one of those,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;I am now, I presume, speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Outlaw, &ldquo;we have each our secret. You are welcome
      to form your judgment of me, and I may use my conjectures touching you,
      though neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are shot at. But as I
      do not pray to be admitted into your mystery, be not offended that I
      preserve my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave pardon, brave Outlaw,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;your reproof is just.
      But it may be we shall meet hereafter with less of concealment on either
      side.&mdash;Meanwhile we part friends, do we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my hand upon it,&rdquo; said Locksley; &ldquo;and I will call it the hand of
      a true Englishman, though an outlaw for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is mine in return,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;and I hold it honoured by
      being clasped with yours. For he that does good, having the unlimited
      power to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which he performs,
      but for the evil which he forbears. Fare thee well, gallant Outlaw!&rdquo; Thus
      parted that fair fellowship; and He of the Fetterlock, mounting upon his
      strong war-horse, rode off through the forest.

      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     KING JOHN.&mdash;I'll tell thee what, my friend,
     He is a very serpent in my way;
     And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
     He lies before me.&mdash;Dost thou understand me?
     &mdash;King John
</pre>
    <p>
      There was brave feasting in the Castle of York, to which Prince John had
      invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he hoped
      to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brother's throne.
      Waldemar Fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret work among
      them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in making
      an open declaration of their purpose. But their enterprise was delayed by
      the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy. The stubborn
      and daring, though brutal courage of Front-de-Boeuf; the buoyant spirits
      and bold bearing of De Bracy; the sagacity, martial experience, and
      renowned valour of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, were important to the success
      of their conspiracy; and, while cursing in secret their unnecessary and
      unmeaning absence, neither John nor his adviser dared to proceed without
      them. Isaac the Jew also seemed to have vanished, and with him the hope of
      certain sums of money, making up the subsidy for which Prince John had
      contracted with that Israelite and his brethren. This deficiency was
      likely to prove perilous in an emergency so critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the morning after the fall of Torquilstone, that a confused
      report began to spread abroad in the city of York, that De Bracy and
      Bois-Guilbert, with their confederate Front-de-Boeuf, had been taken or
      slain. Waldemar brought the rumour to Prince John, announcing, that he
      feared its truth the more that they had set out with a small attendance,
      for the purpose of committing an assault on the Saxon Cedric and his
      attendants. At another time the Prince would have treated this deed of
      violence as a good jest; but now, that it interfered with and impeded his
      own plans, he exclaimed against the perpetrators, and spoke of the broken
      laws, and the infringement of public order and of private property, in a
      tone which might have become King Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unprincipled marauders,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;were I ever to become monarch
      of England, I would hang such transgressors over the drawbridges of their
      own castles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to become monarch of England,&rdquo; said his Ahithophel coolly, &ldquo;it is
      necessary not only that your Grace should endure the transgressions of
      these unprincipled marauders, but that you should afford them your
      protection, notwithstanding your laudable zeal for the laws they are in
      the habit of infringing. We shall be finely helped, if the churl Saxons
      should have realized your Grace's vision, of converting feudal drawbridges
      into gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited Cedric seemeth one to whom such an
      imagination might occur. Your Grace is well aware, it will be dangerous to
      stir without Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and the Templar; and yet we have
      gone too far to recede with safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to stride
      up and down the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The villains,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the base treacherous villains, to desert me at
      this pinch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;who must
      be toying with follies when such business was in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; said the Prince, stopping short before Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing which can be done,&rdquo; answered his counsellor, &ldquo;save that
      which I have already taken order for.&mdash;I came not to bewail this evil
      chance with your Grace, until I had done my best to remedy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art ever my better angel, Waldemar,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;and when I
      have such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of John will be
      renowned in our annals.&mdash;What hast thou commanded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ordered Louis Winkelbrand, De Bracy's lieutenant, to cause his
      trumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently
      forth towards the castle of Front-de-Boeuf, to do what yet may be done for
      the succour of our friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John's face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has
      undergone what it conceives to be an insult. &ldquo;By the face of God!&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;Waldemar Fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over
      malapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or banner to be raised, in a
      town where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave your Grace's pardon,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, internally cursing the idle
      vanity of his patron; &ldquo;but when time pressed, and even the loss of minutes
      might be fatal, I judged it best to take this much burden upon me, in a
      matter of such importance to your Grace's interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art pardoned, Fitzurse,&rdquo; said the prince, gravely; &ldquo;thy purpose hath
      atoned for thy hasty rashness.&mdash;But whom have we here?&mdash;De Bracy
      himself, by the rood!&mdash;and in strange guise doth he come before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed De Bracy&mdash;&ldquo;bloody with spurring, fiery red with speed.&rdquo;
       His armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray, being broken,
      defaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay and
      dust from the crest to the spur. Undoing his helmet, he placed it on the
      table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told his
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Bracy,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;what means this?&mdash;Speak, I charge
      thee!&mdash;Are the Saxons in rebellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, almost in the same moment with his
      master, &ldquo;thou wert wont to be a man&mdash;Where is the Templar?&mdash;where
      Front-de-Boeuf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Templar is fled,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;Front-de-Boeuf you will never see
      more. He has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his own castle
      and I alone am escaped to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold news,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;to us, though you speak of fire and
      conflagration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst news is not yet said,&rdquo; answered De Bracy; and, coming up to
      Prince John, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone&mdash;&ldquo;Richard is in
      England&mdash;I have seen and spoken with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince John turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken
      bench to support himself&mdash;much like to a man who receives an arrow in
      his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou ravest, De Bracy,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;it cannot be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as true as truth itself,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I was his prisoner, and
      spoke with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Richard Plantagenet, sayest thou?&rdquo; continued Fitzurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Richard Plantagenet,&rdquo; replied De Bracy, &ldquo;with Richard Coeur-de-Lion&mdash;with
      Richard of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou wert his prisoner?&rdquo; said Waldemar; &ldquo;he is then at the head of a
      power?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;only a few outlawed yeomen were around him, and to these his
      person is unknown. I heard him say he was about to depart from them. He
      joined them only to assist at the storming of Torquilstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Fitzurse, &ldquo;such is indeed the fashion of Richard&mdash;a true
      knight-errant he, and will wander in wild adventure, trusting the prowess
      of his single arm, like any Sir Guy or Sir Bevis, while the weighty
      affairs of his kingdom slumber, and his own safety is endangered.&mdash;What
      dost thou propose to do De Bracy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused
      them&mdash;I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for
      Flanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always find
      employment. And thou, Waldemar, wilt thou take lance and shield, and lay
      down thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate which God
      sends us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too old, Maurice, and I have a daughter,&rdquo; answered Waldemar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her to me, Fitzurse, and I will maintain her as fits her rank, with
      the help of lance and stirrup,&rdquo; said De Bracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; answered Fitzurse; &ldquo;I will take sanctuary in this church of
      Saint Peter&mdash;the Archbishop is my sworn brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this discourse, Prince John had gradually awakened from the stupor
      into which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence, and had been
      attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his followers. &ldquo;They
      fall off from me,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;they hold no more by me than a
      withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on it!&mdash;Hell and
      fiends! can I shape no means for myself when I am deserted by these
      cravens?&rdquo;&mdash;He paused, and there was an expression of diabolical
      passion in the constrained laugh with which he at length broke in on their
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! my good lords, by the light of Our Lady's brow, I held ye
      sage men, bold men, ready-witted men; yet ye throw down wealth, honour,
      pleasure, all that our noble game promised you, at the moment it might be
      won by one bold cast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you not,&rdquo; said De Bracy. &ldquo;As soon as Richard's return is
      blown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all is then over with
      us. I would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to France or take the
      protection of the Queen Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seek no safety for myself,&rdquo; said Prince John, haughtily; &ldquo;that I could
      secure by a word spoken to my brother. But although you, De Bracy, and
      you, Waldemar Fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, I should not greatly
      delight to see your heads blackening on Clifford's gate yonder. Thinkest
      thou, Waldemar, that the wily Archbishop will not suffer thee to be taken
      from the very horns of the altar, would it make his peace with King
      Richard? And forgettest thou, De Bracy, that Robert Estoteville lies
      betwixt thee and Hull with all his forces, and that the Earl of Essex is
      gathering his followers? If we had reason to fear these levies even before
      Richard's return, trowest thou there is any doubt now which party their
      leaders will take? Trust me, Estoteville alone has strength enough to
      drive all thy Free Lances into the Humber.&rdquo;&mdash;Waldemar Fitzurse and De
      Bracy looked in each other's faces with blank dismay.&mdash;&ldquo;There is but
      one road to safety,&rdquo; continued the Prince, and his brow grew black as
      midnight; &ldquo;this object of our terror journeys alone&mdash;He must be met
      withal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by me,&rdquo; said De Bracy, hastily; &ldquo;I was his prisoner, and he took me
      to mercy. I will not harm a feather in his crest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who spoke of harming him?&rdquo; said Prince John, with a hardened laugh; &ldquo;the
      knave will say next that I meant he should slay him!&mdash;No&mdash;a
      prison were better; and whether in Britain or Austria, what matters it?&mdash;Things
      will be but as they were when we commenced our enterprise&mdash;It was
      founded on the hope that Richard would remain a captive in Germany&mdash;Our
      uncle Robert lived and died in the castle of Cardiffe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but,&rdquo; said Waldemar, &ldquo;your sire Henry sate more firm in his seat than
      your Grace can. I say the best prison is that which is made by the sexton&mdash;no
      dungeon like a church-vault! I have said my say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prison or tomb,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;I wash my hands of the whole matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;thou wouldst not bewray our counsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counsel was never bewrayed by me,&rdquo; said De Bracy, haughtily, &ldquo;nor must
      the name of villain be coupled with mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, Sir Knight!&rdquo; said Waldemar; &ldquo;and you, good my lord, forgive the
      scruples of valiant De Bracy; I trust I shall soon remove them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That passes your eloquence, Fitzurse,&rdquo; replied the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, good Sir Maurice,&rdquo; rejoined the wily politician, &ldquo;start not aside
      like a scared steed, without, at least, considering the object of your
      terror.&mdash;This Richard&mdash;but a day since, and it would have been
      thy dearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks of battle&mdash;a
      hundred times I have heard thee wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;but that was as thou sayest, hand to hand, and in
      the ranks of battle! Thou never heardest me breathe a thought of
      assaulting him alone, and in a forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it,&rdquo; said Waldemar. &ldquo;Was
      it in battle that Lancelot de Lac and Sir Tristram won renown? or was it
      not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep and unknown
      forests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but I promise you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;that neither Tristram nor
      Lancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for Richard Plantagenet, and
      I think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art mad, De Bracy&mdash;what is it we propose to thee, a hired and
      retained captain of Free Companions, whose swords are purchased for Prince
      John's service? Thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou scruplest,
      though thy patron's fortunes, those of thy comrades, thine own, and the
      life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said De Bracy, sullenly, &ldquo;that he gave me my life. True, he
      sent me from his presence, and refused my homage&mdash;so far I owe him
      neither favour nor allegiance&mdash;but I will not lift hand against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It needs not&mdash;send Louis Winkelbrand and a score of thy lances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye have sufficient ruffians of your own,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;not one of mine
      shall budge on such an errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou so obstinate, De Bracy?&rdquo; said Prince John; &ldquo;and wilt thou
      forsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it not,&rdquo; said De Bracy; &ldquo;I will abide by you in aught that becomes
      a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but this highway practice
      comes not within my vow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come hither, Waldemar,&rdquo; said Prince John. &ldquo;An unhappy prince am I. My
      father, King Henry, had faithful servants&mdash;He had but to say that he
      was plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket,
      saint though he was, stained the steps of his own altar.&mdash;Tracy,
      Morville, Brito <a href="#linknote-47" name="linknoteref-47"       id="linknoteref-47"><small>47</small></a> loyal and daring subjects, your
      names, your spirit, are extinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hath left
      a son, he hath fallen off from his father's fidelity and courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has fallen off from neither,&rdquo; said Waldemar Fitzurse; &ldquo;and since it
      may not better be, I will take on me the conduct of this perilous
      enterprise. Dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a
      zealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to Henry fall far short
      of what I am about to afford; for rather would I assail a whole calendar
      of saints, than put spear in rest against Coeur-de-Lion.&mdash;De Bracy,
      to thee I must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard
      Prince John's person. If you receive such news as I trust to send you, our
      enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspect.&mdash;Page,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;hie to my lodgings, and tell my armourer to be there in readiness; and
      bid Stephen Wetheral, Broad Thoresby, and the Three Spears of Spyinghow,
      come to me instantly; and let the scout-master, Hugh Bardon, attend me
      also.&mdash;Adieu, my Prince, till better times.&rdquo; Thus speaking, he left
      the apartment. &ldquo;He goes to make my brother prisoner,&rdquo; said Prince John to
      De Bracy, &ldquo;with as little touch of compunction, as if it but concerned the
      liberty of a Saxon franklin. I trust he will observe our orders, and use
      our dear Richard's person with all due respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Bracy only answered by a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the light of Our Lady's brow,&rdquo; said Prince John, &ldquo;our orders to him
      were most precise&mdash;though it may be you heard them not, as we stood
      together in the oriel window&mdash;Most clear and positive was our charge
      that Richard's safety should be cared for, and woe to Waldemar's head if
      he transgress it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better pass to his lodgings,&rdquo; said De Bracy, &ldquo;and make him fully
      aware of your Grace's pleasure; for, as it quite escaped my ear, it may
      not perchance have reached that of Waldemar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Prince John, impatiently, &ldquo;I promise thee he heard me;
      and, besides, I have farther occupation for thee. Maurice, come hither;
      let me lean on thy shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and Prince
      John, with an air of the most confidential intimacy, proceeded to say,
      &ldquo;What thinkest thou of this Waldemar Fitzurse, my De Bracy?&mdash;He
      trusts to be our Chancellor. Surely we will pause ere we give an office so
      high to one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood, by his
      so readily undertaking this enterprise against Richard. Thou dost think, I
      warrant, that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard, by thy boldly
      declining this unpleasing task&mdash;But no, Maurice! I rather honour thee
      for thy virtuous constancy. There are things most necessary to be done,
      the perpetrator of which we neither love nor honour; and there may be
      refusals to serve us, which shall rather exalt in our estimation those who
      deny our request. The arrest of my unfortunate brother forms no such good
      title to the high office of Chancellor, as thy chivalrous and courageous
      denial establishes in thee to the truncheon of High Marshal. Think of
      this, De Bracy, and begone to thy charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fickle tyrant!&rdquo; muttered De Bracy, as he left the presence of the Prince;
      &ldquo;evil luck have they who trust thee. Thy Chancellor, indeed!&mdash;He who
      hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy charge, I trow. But
      High Marshal of England! that,&rdquo; he said, extending his arm, as if to grasp
      the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride along the antechamber,
      &ldquo;that is indeed a prize worth playing for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Bracy had no sooner left the apartment than Prince John summoned an
      attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bid Hugh Bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall have
      spoken with Waldemar Fitzurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which John traversed
      the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bardon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what did Waldemar desire of thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and skilful
      in tracking the tread of man and horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou hast fitted him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let your grace never trust me else,&rdquo; answered the master of the spies.
      &ldquo;One is from Hexamshire; he is wont to trace the Tynedale and Teviotdale
      thieves, as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer. The other is
      Yorkshire bred, and has twanged his bowstring right oft in merry Sherwood;
      he knows each glade and dingle, copse and high-wood, betwixt this and
      Richmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis well,&rdquo; said the Prince.&mdash;&ldquo;Goes Waldemar forth with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly,&rdquo; said Bardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what attendance?&rdquo; asked John, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broad Thoresby goes with him, and Wetheral, whom they call, for his
      cruelty, Stephen Steel-heart; and three northern men-at-arms that belonged
      to Ralph Middleton's gang&mdash;they are called the Spears of Spyinghow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis well,&rdquo; said Prince John; then added, after a moment's pause,
      &ldquo;Bardon, it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch on Maurice
      De Bracy&mdash;so that he shall not observe it, however&mdash;And let us
      know of his motions from time to time&mdash;with whom he converses, what
      he proposeth. Fail not in this, as thou wilt be answerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Bardon bowed, and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Maurice betrays me,&rdquo; said Prince John&mdash;&ldquo;if he betrays me, as his
      bearing leads me to fear, I will have his head, were Richard thundering at
      the gates of York.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Arouse the tiger of Hyrcanian deserts,
     Strive with the half-starved lion for his prey;
     Lesser the risk, than rouse the slumbering fire
     Of wild Fanaticism.
     &mdash;Anonymus
</pre>
    <p>
      Our tale now returns to Isaac of York.&mdash;Mounted upon a mule, the gift
      of the Outlaw, with two tall yeomen to act as his guard and guides, the
      Jew had set out for the Preceptory of Templestowe, for the purpose of
      negotiating his daughter's redemption. The Preceptory was but a day's
      journey from the demolished castle of Torquilstone, and the Jew had hoped
      to reach it before nightfall; accordingly, having dismissed his guides at
      the verge of the forest, and rewarded them with a piece of silver, he
      began to press on with such speed as his weariness permitted him to exert.
      But his strength failed him totally ere he had reached within four miles
      of the Temple-Court; racking pains shot along his back and through his
      limbs, and the excessive anguish which he felt at heart being now
      augmented by bodily suffering, he was rendered altogether incapable of
      proceeding farther than a small market-town, were dwelt a Jewish Rabbi of
      his tribe, eminent in the medical profession, and to whom Isaac was well
      known. Nathan Ben Israel received his suffering countryman with that
      kindness which the law prescribed, and which the Jews practised to each
      other. He insisted on his betaking himself to repose, and used such
      remedies as were then in most repute to check the progress of the fever,
      which terror, fatigue, ill usage, and sorrow, had brought upon the poor
      old Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, when Isaac proposed to arise and pursue his journey, Nathan
      remonstrated against his purpose, both as his host and as his physician.
      It might cost him, he said, his life. But Isaac replied, that more than
      life and death depended upon his going that morning to Templestowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Templestowe!&rdquo; said his host with surprise again felt his pulse, and
      then muttered to himself, &ldquo;His fever is abated, yet seems his mind
      somewhat alienated and disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not to Templestowe?&rdquo; answered his patient. &ldquo;I grant thee, Nathan,
      that it is a dwelling of those to whom the despised Children of the
      Promise are a stumbling-block and an abomination; yet thou knowest that
      pressing affairs of traffic sometimes carry us among these bloodthirsty
      Nazarene soldiers, and that we visit the Preceptories of the Templars, as
      well as the Commanderies of the Knights Hospitallers, as they are called.&rdquo;
       <a href="#linknote-48" name="linknoteref-48" id="linknoteref-48"><small>48</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; said Nathan; &ldquo;but wottest thou that Lucas de Beaumanoir,
      the chief of their Order, and whom they term Grand Master, is now himself
      at Templestowe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it not,&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;our last letters from our brethren at Paris
      advised us that he was at that city, beseeching Philip for aid against the
      Sultan Saladine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hath since come to England, unexpected by his brethren,&rdquo; said Ben
      Israel; &ldquo;and he cometh among them with a strong and outstretched arm to
      correct and to punish. His countenance is kindled in anger against those
      who have departed from the vow which they have made, and great is the fear
      of those sons of Belial. Thou must have heard of his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well known unto me,&rdquo; said Isaac; &ldquo;the Gentiles deliver this Lucas
      Beaumanoir as a man zealous to slaying for every point of the Nazarene
      law; and our brethren have termed him a fierce destroyer of the Saracens,
      and a cruel tyrant to the Children of the Promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And truly have they termed him,&rdquo; said Nathan the physician. &ldquo;Other
      Templars may be moved from the purpose of their heart by pleasure, or
      bribed by promise of gold and silver; but Beaumanoir is of a different
      stamp&mdash;hating sensuality, despising treasure, and pressing forward to
      that which they call the crown of martyrdom&mdash;The God of Jacob
      speedily send it unto him, and unto them all! Specially hath this proud
      man extended his glove over the children of Judah, as holy David over
      Edom, holding the murder of a Jew to be an offering of as sweet savour as
      the death of a Saracen. Impious and false things has he said even of the
      virtues of our medicines, as if they were the devices of Satan&mdash;The
      Lord rebuke him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;I must present myself at Templestowe, though
      he hath made his face like unto a fiery furnace seven times heated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then explained to Nathan the pressing cause of his journey. The Rabbi
      listened with interest, and testified his sympathy after the fashion of
      his people, rending his clothes, and saying, &ldquo;Ah, my daughter!&mdash;ah,
      my daughter!&mdash;Alas! for the beauty of Zion!&mdash;Alas! for the
      captivity of Israel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou seest,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;how it stands with me, and that I may not
      tarry. Peradventure, the presence of this Lucas Beaumanoir, being the
      chief man over them, may turn Brian de Bois-Guilbert from the ill which he
      doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter Rebecca.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go thou,&rdquo; said Nathan Ben Israel, &ldquo;and be wise, for wisdom availed Daniel
      in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may it go well with thee,
      even as thine heart wisheth. Yet, if thou canst, keep thee from the
      presence of the Grand Master, for to do foul scorn to our people is his
      morning and evening delight. It may be if thou couldst speak with
      Bois-Guilbert in private, thou shalt the better prevail with him; for men
      say that these accursed Nazarenes are not of one mind in the Preceptory&mdash;May
      their counsels be confounded and brought to shame! But do thou, brother,
      return to me as if it were to the house of thy father, and bring me word
      how it has sped with thee; and well do I hope thou wilt bring with thee
      Rebecca, even the scholar of the wise Miriam, whose cures the Gentiles
      slandered as if they had been wrought by necromancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac accordingly bade his friend farewell, and about an hour's riding
      brought him before the Preceptory of Templestowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This establishment of the Templars was seated amidst fair meadows and
      pastures, which the devotion of the former Preceptor had bestowed upon
      their Order. It was strong and well fortified, a point never neglected by
      these knights, and which the disordered state of England rendered
      peculiarly necessary. Two halberdiers, clad in black, guarded the
      drawbridge, and others, in the same sad livery, glided to and fro upon the
      walls with a funereal pace, resembling spectres more than soldiers. The
      inferior officers of the Order were thus dressed, ever since their use of
      white garments, similar to those of the knights and esquires, had given
      rise to a combination of certain false brethren in the mountains of
      Palestine, terming themselves Templars, and bringing great dishonour on
      the Order. A knight was now and then seen to cross the court in his long
      white cloak, his head depressed on his breast, and his arms folded. They
      passed each other, if they chanced to meet, with a slow, solemn, and mute
      greeting; for such was the rule of their Order, quoting thereupon the holy
      texts, &ldquo;In many words thou shalt not avoid sin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life and death are
      in the power of the tongue.&rdquo; In a word, the stern ascetic rigour of the
      Temple discipline, which had been so long exchanged for prodigal and
      licentious indulgence, seemed at once to have revived at Templestowe under
      the severe eye of Lucas Beaumanoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac paused at the gate, to consider how he might seek entrance in the
      manner most likely to bespeak favour; for he was well aware, that to his
      unhappy race the reviving fanaticism of the Order was not less dangerous
      than their unprincipled licentiousness; and that his religion would be the
      object of hate and persecution in the one case, as his wealth would have
      exposed him in the other to the extortions of unrelenting oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Lucas Beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging to the
      Preceptory, included within the precincts of its exterior fortification,
      and held sad and confidential communication with a brother of his Order,
      who had come in his company from Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master was a man advanced in age, as was testified by his long
      grey beard, and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhanging eyes, of which,
      however, years had been unable to quench the fire. A formidable warrior,
      his thin and severe features retained the soldier's fierceness of
      expression; an ascetic bigot, they were no less marked by the emaciation
      of abstinence, and the spiritual pride of the self-satisfied devotee. Yet
      with these severer traits of physiognomy, there was mixed somewhat
      striking and noble, arising, doubtless, from the great part which his high
      office called upon him to act among monarchs and princes, and from the
      habitual exercise of supreme authority over the valiant and high-born
      knights, who were united by the rules of the Order. His stature was tall,
      and his gait, undepressed by age and toil, was erect and stately. His
      white mantle was shaped with severe regularity, according to the rule of
      Saint Bernard himself, being composed of what was then called Burrel
      cloth, exactly fitted to the size of the wearer, and bearing on the left
      shoulder the octangular cross peculiar to the Order, formed of red cloth.
      No vair or ermine decked this garment; but in respect of his age, the
      Grand Master, as permitted by the rules, wore his doublet lined and
      trimmed with the softest lambskin, dressed with the wool outwards, which
      was the nearest approach he could regularly make to the use of fur, then
      the greatest luxury of dress. In his hand he bore that singular &ldquo;abacus&rdquo;,
      or staff of office, with which Templars are usually represented, having at
      the upper end a round plate, on which was engraved the cross of the Order,
      inscribed within a circle or orle, as heralds term it. His companion, who
      attended on this great personage, had nearly the same dress in all
      respects, but his extreme deference towards his Superior showed that no
      other equality subsisted between them. The Preceptor, for such he was in
      rank, walked not in a line with the Grand Master, but just so far behind
      that Beaumanoir could speak to him without turning round his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conrade,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;dear companion of my battles and my
      toils, to thy faithful bosom alone I can confide my sorrows. To thee alone
      can I tell how oft, since I came to this kingdom, I have desired to be
      dissolved and to be with the just. Not one object in England hath met mine
      eye which it could rest upon with pleasure, save the tombs of our
      brethren, beneath the massive roof of our Temple Church in yonder proud
      capital. O, valiant Robert de Ros! did I exclaim internally, as I gazed
      upon these good soldiers of the cross, where they lie sculptured on their
      sepulchres,&mdash;O, worthy William de Mareschal! open your marble cells,
      and take to your repose a weary brother, who would rather strive with a
      hundred thousand pagans than witness the decay of our Holy Order!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but true,&rdquo; answered Conrade Mont-Fitchet; &ldquo;it is but too true; and
      the irregularities of our brethren in England are even more gross than
      those in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they are more wealthy,&rdquo; answered the Grand Master. &ldquo;Bear with me,
      brother, although I should something vaunt myself. Thou knowest the life I
      have led, keeping each point of my Order, striving with devils embodied
      and disembodied, striking down the roaring lion, who goeth about seeking
      whom he may devour, like a good knight and devout priest, wheresoever I
      met with him&mdash;even as blessed Saint Bernard hath prescribed to us in
      the forty-fifth capital of our rule, 'Ut Leo semper feriatur'. <a
      href="#linknote-49" name="linknoteref-49" id="linknoteref-49"><small>49</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by the Holy Temple! the zeal which hath devoured my substance and my
      life, yea, the very nerves and marrow of my bones; by that very Holy
      Temple I swear to thee, that save thyself and some few that still retain
      the ancient severity of our Order, I look upon no brethren whom I can
      bring my soul to embrace under that holy name. What say our statutes, and
      how do our brethren observe them? They should wear no vain or worldly
      ornament, no crest upon their helmet, no gold upon stirrup or bridle-bit;
      yet who now go pranked out so proudly and so gaily as the poor soldiers of
      the Temple? They are forbidden by our statutes to take one bird by means
      of another, to shoot beasts with bow or arblast, to halloo to a
      hunting-horn, or to spur the horse after game. But now, at hunting and
      hawking, and each idle sport of wood and river, who so prompt as the
      Templars in all these fond vanities? They are forbidden to read, save what
      their Superior permitted, or listen to what is read, save such holy things
      as may be recited aloud during the hours of refaction; but lo! their ears
      are at the command of idle minstrels, and their eyes study empty romaunts.
      They were commanded to extirpate magic and heresy. Lo! they are charged
      with studying the accursed cabalistical secrets of the Jews, and the magic
      of the Paynim Saracens. Simpleness of diet was prescribed to them, roots,
      pottage, gruels, eating flesh but thrice a-week, because the accustomed
      feeding on flesh is a dishonourable corruption of the body; and behold,
      their tables groan under delicate fare! Their drink was to be water, and
      now, to drink like a Templar, is the boast of each jolly boon companion!
      This very garden, filled as it is with curious herbs and trees sent from
      the Eastern climes, better becomes the harem of an unbelieving Emir, than
      the plot which Christian Monks should devote to raise their homely
      pot-herbs.&mdash;And O, Conrade! well it were that the relaxation of
      discipline stopped even here!&mdash;Well thou knowest that we were
      forbidden to receive those devout women, who at the beginning were
      associated as sisters of our Order, because, saith the forty-sixth
      chapter, the Ancient Enemy hath, by female society, withdrawn many from
      the right path to paradise. Nay, in the last capital, being, as it were,
      the cope-stone which our blessed founder placed on the pure and undefiled
      doctrine which he had enjoined, we are prohibited from offering, even to
      our sisters and our mothers, the kiss of affection&mdash;'ut omnium
      mulierum fugiantur oscula'.&mdash;I shame to speak&mdash;I shame to think&mdash;of
      the corruptions which have rushed in upon us even like a flood. The souls
      of our pure founders, the spirits of Hugh de Payen and Godfrey de Saint
      Omer, and of the blessed Seven who first joined in dedicating their lives
      to the service of the Temple, are disturbed even in the enjoyment of
      paradise itself. I have seen them, Conrade, in the visions of the night&mdash;their
      sainted eyes shed tears for the sins and follies of their brethren, and
      for the foul and shameful luxury in which they wallow. Beaumanoir, they
      say, thou slumberest&mdash;awake! There is a stain in the fabric of the
      Temple, deep and foul as that left by the streaks of leprosy on the walls
      of the infected houses of old. <a href="#linknote-50" name="linknoteref-50"       id="linknoteref-50"><small>50</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soldiers of the Cross, who should shun the glance of a woman as the
      eye of a basilisk, live in open sin, not with the females of their own
      race only, but with the daughters of the accursed heathen, and more
      accursed Jew. Beaumanoir, thou sleepest; up, and avenge our cause!&mdash;Slay
      the sinners, male and female!&mdash;Take to thee the brand of Phineas!&mdash;The
      vision fled, Conrade, but as I awaked I could still hear the clank of
      their mail, and see the waving of their white mantles.&mdash;And I will do
      according to their word, I WILL purify the fabric of the Temple! and the
      unclean stones in which the plague is, I will remove and cast out of the
      building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet bethink thee, reverend father,&rdquo; said Mont-Fitchet, &ldquo;the stain hath
      become engrained by time and consuetude; let thy reformation be cautious,
      as it is just and wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mont-Fitchet,&rdquo; answered the stern old man&mdash;&ldquo;it must be sharp and
      sudden&mdash;the Order is on the crisis of its fate. The sobriety,
      self-devotion, and piety of our predecessors, made us powerful friends&mdash;our
      presumption, our wealth, our luxury, have raised up against us mighty
      enemies.&mdash;We must cast away these riches, which are a temptation to
      princes&mdash;we must lay down that presumption, which is an offence to
      them&mdash;we must reform that license of manners, which is a scandal to
      the whole Christian world! Or&mdash;mark my words&mdash;the Order of the
      Temple will be utterly demolished&mdash;and the Place thereof shall no
      more be known among the nations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now may God avert such a calamity!&rdquo; said the Preceptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, with solemnity, &ldquo;but we must deserve his
      aid. I tell thee, Conrade, that neither the powers in Heaven, nor the
      powers on earth, will longer endure the wickedness of this generation&mdash;My
      intelligence is sure&mdash;the ground on which our fabric is reared is
      already undermined, and each addition we make to the structure of our
      greatness will only sink it the sooner in the abyss. We must retrace our
      steps, and show ourselves the faithful Champions of the Cross, sacrificing
      to our calling, not alone our blood and our lives&mdash;not alone our
      lusts and our vices&mdash;but our ease, our comforts, and our natural
      affections, and act as men convinced that many a pleasure which may be
      lawful to others, is forbidden to the vowed soldier of the Temple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a squire, clothed in a threadbare vestment, (for the
      aspirants after this holy Order wore during their noviciate the cast-off
      garments of the knights,) entered the garden, and, bowing profoundly
      before the Grand Master, stood silent, awaiting his permission ere he
      presumed to tell his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not more seemly,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;to see this Damian,
      clothed in the garments of Christian humility, thus appear with reverend
      silence before his Superior, than but two days since, when the fond fool
      was decked in a painted coat, and jangling as pert and as proud as any
      popinjay?&mdash;Speak, Damian, we permit thee&mdash;What is thine errand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Jew stands without the gate, noble and reverend father,&rdquo; said the
      Squire, &ldquo;who prays to speak with brother Brian de Bois-Guilbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wert right to give me knowledge of it,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;in
      our presence a Preceptor is but as a common compeer of our Order, who may
      not walk according to his own will, but to that of his Master&mdash;even
      according to the text, 'In the hearing of the ear he hath obeyed me.'&mdash;It
      imports us especially to know of this Bois-Guilbert's proceedings,&rdquo; said
      he, turning to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Report speaks him brave and valiant,&rdquo; said Conrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And truly is he so spoken of,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;in our valour only
      we are not degenerated from our predecessors, the heroes of the Cross. But
      brother Brian came into our Order a moody and disappointed man, stirred, I
      doubt me, to take our vows and to renounce the world, not in sincerity of
      soul, but as one whom some touch of light discontent had driven into
      penitence. Since then, he hath become an active and earnest agitator, a
      murmurer, and a machinator, and a leader amongst those who impugn our
      authority; not considering that the rule is given to the Master even by
      the symbol of the staff and the rod&mdash;the staff to support the
      infirmities of the weak&mdash;the rod to correct the faults of
      delinquents.&mdash;Damian,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;lead the Jew to our presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire departed with a profound reverence, and in a few minutes
      returned, marshalling in Isaac of York. No naked slave, ushered into the
      presence of some mighty prince, could approach his judgment-seat with more
      profound reverence and terror than that with which the Jew drew near to
      the presence of the Grand Master. When he had approached within the
      distance of three yards, Beaumanoir made a sign with his staff that he
      should come no farther. The Jew kneeled down on the earth which he kissed
      in token of reverence; then rising, stood before the Templars, his hands
      folded on his bosom, his head bowed on his breast, in all the submission
      of Oriental slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damian,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;retire, and have a guard ready to await
      our sudden call; and suffer no one to enter the garden until we shall
      leave it.&rdquo;&mdash;The squire bowed and retreated.&mdash;&ldquo;Jew,&rdquo; continued
      the haughty old man, &ldquo;mark me. It suits not our condition to hold with
      thee long communication, nor do we waste words or time upon any one.
      Wherefore be brief in thy answers to what questions I shall ask thee, and
      let thy words be of truth; for if thy tongue doubles with me, I will have
      it torn from thy misbelieving jaws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jew was about to reply, but the Grand Master went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, unbeliever!&mdash;not a word in our presence, save in answer to
      our questions.&mdash;What is thy business with our brother Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac gasped with terror and uncertainty. To tell his tale might be
      interpreted into scandalizing the Order; yet, unless he told it, what hope
      could he have of achieving his daughter's deliverance? Beaumanoir saw his
      mortal apprehension, and condescended to give him some assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for thy wretched person, Jew, so thou dealest
      uprightly in this matter. I demand again to know from thee thy business
      with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bearer of a letter,&rdquo; stammered out the Jew, &ldquo;so please your reverend
      valour, to that good knight, from Prior Aymer of the Abbey of Jorvaulx.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said I not these were evil times, Conrade?&rdquo; said the Master. &ldquo;A
      Cistertian Prior sends a letter to a soldier of the Temple, and can find
      no more fitting messenger than an unbelieving Jew.&mdash;Give me the
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jew, with trembling hands, undid the folds of his Armenian cap, in
      which he had deposited the Prior's tablets for the greater security, and
      was about to approach, with hand extended and body crouched, to place it
      within the reach of his grim interrogator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, dog!&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;I touch not misbelievers, save with
      the sword.&mdash;Conrade, take thou the letter from the Jew, and give it
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaumanoir, being thus possessed of the tablets, inspected the outside
      carefully, and then proceeded to undo the packthread which secured its
      folds. &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; said Conrade, interposing, though with much
      deference, &ldquo;wilt thou break the seal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will I not?&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, with a frown. &ldquo;Is it not written in the
      forty-second capital, 'De Lectione Literarum' that a Templar shall not
      receive a letter, no not from his father, without communicating the same
      to the Grand Master, and reading it in his presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and
      horror; read it over again more slowly; then holding it out to Conrade
      with one hand, and slightly striking it with the other, exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Here
      is goodly stuff for one Christian man to write to another, and both
      members, and no inconsiderable members, of religious professions! When,&rdquo;
       said he solemnly, and looking upward, &ldquo;wilt thou come with thy fanners to
      purge the thrashing-floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mont-Fitchet took the letter from his Superior, and was about to peruse
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it aloud, Conrade,&rdquo; said the Grand Master,&mdash;&ldquo;and do thou&rdquo; (to
      Isaac) &ldquo;attend to the purport of it, for we will question thee concerning
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conrade read the letter, which was in these words: &ldquo;Aymer, by divine
      grace, Prior of the Cistertian house of Saint Mary's of Jorvaulx, to Sir
      Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a Knight of the holy Order of the Temple, wisheth
      health, with the bounties of King Bacchus and of my Lady Venus. Touching
      our present condition, dear Brother, we are a captive in the hands of
      certain lawless and godless men, who have not feared to detain our person,
      and put us to ransom; whereby we have also learned of Front-de-Boeuf's
      misfortune, and that thou hast escaped with that fair Jewish sorceress,
      whose black eyes have bewitched thee. We are heartily rejoiced of thy
      safety; nevertheless, we pray thee to be on thy guard in the matter of
      this second Witch of Endor; for we are privately assured that your Great
      Master, who careth not a bean for cherry cheeks and black eyes, comes from
      Normandy to diminish your mirth, and amend your misdoings. Wherefore we
      pray you heartily to beware, and to be found watching, even as the Holy
      Text hath it, 'Invenientur vigilantes'. And the wealthy Jew her father,
      Isaac of York, having prayed of me letters in his behalf, I gave him
      these, earnestly advising, and in a sort entreating, that you do hold the
      damsel to ransom, seeing he will pay you from his bags as much as may find
      fifty damsels upon safer terms, whereof I trust to have my part when we
      make merry together, as true brothers, not forgetting the wine-cup. For
      what saith the text, 'Vinum laetificat cor hominis'; and again, 'Rex
      delectabitur pulchritudine tua'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till which merry meeting, we wish you farewell. Given from this den of
      thieves, about the hour of matins,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aymer Pr. S. M. Jorvolciencis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Postscriptum.' Truly your golden chain hath not long abidden with me,
      and will now sustain, around the neck of an outlaw deer-stealer, the
      whistle wherewith he calleth on his hounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sayest thou to this, Conrade?&rdquo; said the Grand Master&mdash;&ldquo;Den of
      thieves! and a fit residence is a den of thieves for such a Prior. No
      wonder that the hand of God is upon us, and that in the Holy Land we lose
      place by place, foot by foot, before the infidels, when we have such
      churchmen as this Aymer.&mdash;And what meaneth he, I trow, by this second
      Witch of Endor?&rdquo; said he to his confident, something apart. Conrade was
      better acquainted (perhaps by practice) with the jargon of gallantry, than
      was his Superior; and he expounded the passage which embarrassed the Grand
      Master, to be a sort of language used by worldly men towards those whom
      they loved 'par amours'; but the explanation did not satisfy the bigoted
      Beaumanoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is more in it than thou dost guess, Conrade; thy simplicity is no
      match for this deep abyss of wickedness. This Rebecca of York was a pupil
      of that Miriam of whom thou hast heard. Thou shalt hear the Jew own it
      even now.&rdquo; Then turning to Isaac, he said aloud, &ldquo;Thy daughter, then, is
      prisoner with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, reverend valorous sir,&rdquo; stammered poor Isaac, &ldquo;and whatsoever ransom
      a poor man may pay for her deliverance&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;This thy daughter hath practised the art
      of healing, hath she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, gracious sir,&rdquo; answered the Jew, with more confidence; &ldquo;and knight
      and yeoman, squire and vassal, may bless the goodly gift which Heaven hath
      assigned to her. Many a one can testify that she hath recovered them by
      her art, when every other human aid hath proved vain; but the blessing of
      the God of Jacob was upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaumanoir turned to Mont-Fitchet with a grim smile. &ldquo;See, brother,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;the deceptions of the devouring Enemy! Behold the baits with which
      he fishes for souls, giving a poor space of earthly life in exchange for
      eternal happiness hereafter. Well said our blessed rule, 'Semper
      percutiatur leo vorans'.&mdash;Up on the lion! Down with the destroyer!&rdquo;
       said he, shaking aloft his mystic abacus, as if in defiance of the powers
      of darkness&mdash;&ldquo;Thy daughter worketh the cures, I doubt not,&rdquo; thus he
      went on to address the Jew, &ldquo;by words and sighs, and periapts, and other
      cabalistical mysteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, reverend and brave Knight,&rdquo; answered Isaac, &ldquo;but in chief measure by
      a balsam of marvellous virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where had she that secret?&rdquo; said Beaumanoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was delivered to her,&rdquo; answered Isaac, reluctantly, &ldquo;by Miriam, a sage
      matron of our tribe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, false Jew!&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;was it not from that same witch
      Miriam, the abomination of whose enchantments have been heard of
      throughout every Christian land?&rdquo; exclaimed the Grand Master, crossing
      himself. &ldquo;Her body was burnt at a stake, and her ashes were scattered to
      the four winds; and so be it with me and mine Order, if I do not as much
      to her pupil, and more also! I will teach her to throw spell and
      incantation over the soldiers of the blessed Temple.&mdash;There, Damian,
      spurn this Jew from the gate&mdash;shoot him dead if he oppose or turn
      again. With his daughter we will deal as the Christian law and our own
      high office warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Isaac was hurried off accordingly, and expelled from the preceptory;
      all his entreaties, and even his offers, unheard and disregarded. He could
      do not better than return to the house of the Rabbi, and endeavour,
      through his means, to learn how his daughter was to be disposed of. He had
      hitherto feared for her honour, he was now to tremble for her life.
      Meanwhile, the Grand Master ordered to his presence the Preceptor of
      Templestowe.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Say not my art is fraud&mdash;all live by seeming.
     The beggar begs with it, and the gay courtier
     Gains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;

     &mdash;Old Play
</pre>
    <p>
      Albert Malvoisin, President, or, in the language of the Order, Preceptor
      of the establishment of Templestowe, was brother to that Philip Malvoisin
      who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history, and was, like
      that baron, in close league with Brian de Bois-Guilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the Temple Order included
      but too many, Albert of Templestowe might be distinguished; but with this
      difference from the audacious Bois-Guilbert, that he knew how to throw
      over his vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy, and to assume in
      his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised. Had not the
      arrival of the Grand Master been so unexpectedly sudden, he would have
      seen nothing at Templestowe which might have appeared to argue any
      relaxation of discipline. And, even although surprised, and, to a certain
      extent, detected, Albert Malvoisin listened with such respect and apparent
      contrition to the rebuke of his Superior, and made such haste to reform
      the particulars he censured,&mdash;succeeded, in fine, so well in giving
      an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been lately devoted to
      license and pleasure, that Lucas Beaumanoir began to entertain a higher
      opinion of the Preceptor's morals, than the first appearance of the
      establishment had inclined him to adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these favourable sentiments on the part of the Grand Master were
      greatly shaken by the intelligence that Albert had received within a house
      of religion the Jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the paramour of
      a brother of the Order; and when Albert appeared before him, he was
      regarded with unwonted sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy Order of
      the Temple,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, in a severe tone, &ldquo;a Jewish woman,
      brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, Sir
      Preceptor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert Malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate
      Rebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building, and
      every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being known. He
      read in the looks of Beaumanoir ruin to Bois-Guilbert and to himself,
      unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you mute?&rdquo; continued the Grand Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it permitted to me to reply?&rdquo; answered the Preceptor, in a tone of the
      deepest humility, although by the question he only meant to gain an
      instant's space for arranging his ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, you are permitted,&rdquo; said the Grand Master&mdash;&ldquo;speak, and say,
      knowest thou the capital of our holy rule,&mdash;'De commilitonibus Templi
      in sancta civitate, qui cum miserrimis mulieribus versantur, propter
      oblectationem carnis?'&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-51" name="linknoteref-51"       id="linknoteref-51"><small>51</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, most reverend father,&rdquo; answered the Preceptor, &ldquo;I have not risen
      to this office in the Order, being ignorant of one of its most important
      prohibitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How comes it, then, I demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered a
      brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a Jewish sorceress, into
      this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Jewish sorceress!&rdquo; echoed Albert Malvoisin; &ldquo;good angels guard us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, brother, a Jewish sorceress!&rdquo; said the Grand Master, sternly. &ldquo;I have
      said it. Darest thou deny that this Rebecca, the daughter of that wretched
      usurer Isaac of York, and the pupil of the foul witch Miriam, is now&mdash;shame
      to be thought or spoken!&mdash;lodged within this thy Preceptory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wisdom, reverend father,&rdquo; answered the Preceptor, &ldquo;hath rolled away
      the darkness from my understanding. Much did I wonder that so good a
      knight as Brian de Bois-Guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the charms
      of this female, whom I received into this house merely to place a bar
      betwixt their growing intimacy, which else might have been cemented at the
      expense of the fall of our valiant and religious brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow?&rdquo;
       demanded the Grand Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! under this roof?&rdquo; said the Preceptor, crossing himself; &ldquo;Saint
      Magdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!&mdash;No! if I have sinned
      in receiving her here, it was in the erring thought that I might thus
      break off our brother's besotted devotion to this Jewess, which seemed to
      me so wild and unnatural, that I could not but ascribe it to some touch of
      insanity, more to be cured by pity than reproof. But since your reverend
      wisdom hath discovered this Jewish queen to be a sorceress, perchance it
      may account fully for his enamoured folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doth!&mdash;it doth!&rdquo; said Beaumanoir. &ldquo;See, brother Conrade, the
      peril of yielding to the first devices and blandishments of Satan! We look
      upon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye, and to take pleasure in
      what men call her beauty; and the Ancient Enemy, the devouring Lion,
      obtains power over us, to complete, by talisman and spell, a work which
      was begun by idleness and folly. It may be that our brother Bois-Guilbert
      does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe chastisement; rather
      the support of the staff, than the strokes of the rod; and that our
      admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly, and restore him to
      his brethren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were deep pity,&rdquo; said Conrade Mont-Fitchet, &ldquo;to lose to the Order one
      of its best lances, when the Holy Community most requires the aid of its
      sons. Three hundred Saracens hath this Brian de Bois-Guilbert slain with
      his own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blood of these accursed dogs,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;shall be a
      sweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom they despise
      and blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells and charms
      with which our brother is entwined as in a net. He shall burst the bands
      of this Delilah, as Sampson burst the two new cords with which the
      Philistines had bound him, and shall slaughter the infidels, even heaps
      upon heaps. But concerning this foul witch, who hath flung her
      enchantments over a brother of the Holy Temple, assuredly she shall die
      the death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the laws of England,&rdquo;&mdash;said the Preceptor, who, though delighted
      that the Grand Master's resentment, thus fortunately averted from himself
      and Bois-Guilbert, had taken another direction, began now to fear he was
      carrying it too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The laws of England,&rdquo; interrupted Beaumanoir, &ldquo;permit and enjoin each
      judge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. The most petty baron
      may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain. And
      shall that power be denied to the Grand Master of the Temple within a
      preceptory of his Order?&mdash;No!&mdash;we will judge and condemn. The
      witch shall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be
      forgiven. Prepare the Castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert Malvoisin bowed and retired,&mdash;not to give directions for
      preparing the hall, but to seek out Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and
      communicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. It was not long
      ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse he had anew
      sustained from the fair Jewess. &ldquo;The unthinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
      ungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and flames, would have saved
      her life at the risk of his own! By Heaven, Malvoisin! I abode until roof
      and rafters crackled and crashed around me. I was the butt of a hundred
      arrows; they rattled on mine armour like hailstones against a latticed
      casement, and the only use I made of my shield was for her protection.
      This did I endure for her; and now the self-willed girl upbraids me that I
      did not leave her to perish, and refuses me not only the slightest proof
      of gratitude, but even the most distant hope that ever she will be brought
      to grant any. The devil, that possessed her race with obstinacy, has
      concentrated its full force in her single person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said the Preceptor, &ldquo;I think, possessed you both. How oft
      have I preached to you caution, if not continence? Did I not tell you that
      there were enough willing Christian damsels to be met with, who would
      think it sin to refuse so brave a knight 'le don d'amoureux merci', and
      you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate Jewess! By the
      mass, I think old Lucas Beaumanoir guesses right, when he maintains she
      hath cast a spell over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucas Beaumanoir!&rdquo;&mdash;said Bois-Guilbert reproachfully&mdash;&ldquo;Are
      these your precautions, Malvoisin? Hast thou suffered the dotard to learn
      that Rebecca is in the Preceptory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I help it?&rdquo; said the Preceptor. &ldquo;I neglected nothing that could
      keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by the devil or
      no, the devil only can tell. But I have turned the matter as I could; you
      are safe if you renounce Rebecca. You are pitied&mdash;the victim of
      magical delusion. She is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall not, by Heaven!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, she must and will!&rdquo; said Malvoisin. &ldquo;Neither you nor any one
      else can save her. Lucas Beaumanoir hath settled that the death of a
      Jewess will be a sin-offering sufficient to atone for all the amorous
      indulgences of the Knights Templars; and thou knowest he hath both the
      power and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!&rdquo; said
      Bois-Guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What they may believe, I know not,&rdquo; said Malvoisin, calmly; &ldquo;but I know
      well, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take ninety-nine to the
      hundred, will cry 'amen' to the Grand Master's sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;Albert, thou art my friend. Thou must
      connive at her escape, Malvoisin, and I will transport her to some place
      of greater security and secrecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, if I would,&rdquo; replied the Preceptor; &ldquo;the mansion is filled with
      the attendants of the Grand Master, and others who are devoted to him.
      And, to be frank with you, brother, I would not embark with you in this
      matter, even if I could hope to bring my bark to haven. I have risked
      enough already for your sake. I have no mind to encounter a sentence of
      degradation, or even to lose my Preceptory, for the sake of a painted
      piece of Jewish flesh and blood. And you, if you will be guided by my
      counsel, will give up this wild-goose chase, and fly your hawk at some
      other game. Think, Bois-Guilbert,&mdash;thy present rank, thy future
      honours, all depend on thy place in the Order. Shouldst thou adhere
      perversely to thy passion for this Rebecca, thou wilt give Beaumanoir the
      power of expelling thee, and he will not neglect it. He is jealous of the
      truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe, and he knows thou
      stretchest thy bold hand towards it. Doubt not he will ruin thee, if thou
      affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of a Jewish sorceress.
      Give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst not control him. When
      the staff is in thine own firm grasp, thou mayest caress the daughters of
      Judah, or burn them, as may best suit thine own humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malvoisin,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;thou art a cold-blooded&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said the Preceptor, hastening to fill up the blank, in which
      Bois-Guilbert would probably have placed a worse word,&mdash;&ldquo;a
      cold-blooded friend I am, and therefore more fit to give thee advice. I
      tell thee once more, that thou canst not save Rebecca. I tell thee once
      more, thou canst but perish with her. Go hie thee to the Grand Master&mdash;throw
      thyself at his feet and tell him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at his feet, by Heaven! but to the dotard's very beard will I say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to him, then, to his beard,&rdquo; continued Malvoisin, coolly, &ldquo;that you
      love this captive Jewess to distraction; and the more thou dost enlarge on
      thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of the
      fair enchantress; while thou, taken in flagrant delict by the avowal of a
      crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy brethren, and must
      exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power, to lift perhaps
      a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between Flanders and
      Burgundy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou speakest the truth, Malvoisin,&rdquo; said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after a
      moment's reflection. &ldquo;I will give the hoary bigot no advantage over me;
      and for Rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that I should expose rank
      and honour for her sake. I will cast her off&mdash;yes, I will leave her
      to her fate, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Qualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,&rdquo; said Malvoisin; &ldquo;women
      are but the toys which amuse our lighter hours&mdash;ambition is the
      serious business of life. Perish a thousand such frail baubles as this
      Jewess, before thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies
      stretched before thee! For the present we part, nor must we be seen to
      hold close conversation&mdash;I must order the hall for his
      judgment-seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the Preceptor, &ldquo;trial moves rapidly on when the judge has
      determined the sentence beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, when he was left alone, &ldquo;thou art like to
      cost me dear&mdash;Why cannot I abandon thee to thy fate, as this calm
      hypocrite recommends?&mdash;One effort will I make to save thee&mdash;but
      beware of ingratitude! for if I am again repulsed, my vengeance shall
      equal my love. The life and honour of Bois-Guilbert must not be hazarded,
      where contempt and reproaches are his only reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined by
      Conrade Mont-Fitchet, who acquainted him with the Grand Master's
      resolution to bring the Jewess to instant trial for sorcery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is surely a dream,&rdquo; said the Preceptor; &ldquo;we have many Jewish
      physicians, and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful
      cures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Grand Master thinks otherwise,&rdquo; said Mont-Fitchet; &ldquo;and, Albert, I
      will be upright with thee&mdash;wizard or not, it were better that this
      miserable damsel die, than that Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be lost to
      the Order, or the Order divided by internal dissension. Thou knowest his
      high rank, his fame in arms&mdash;thou knowest the zeal with which many of
      our brethren regard him&mdash;but all this will not avail him with our
      Grand Master, should he consider Brian as the accomplice, not the victim,
      of this Jewess. Were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body, it
      were better she suffered alone, than that Bois-Guilbert were partner in
      her destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been working him even now to abandon her,&rdquo; said Malvoisin; &ldquo;but
      still, are there grounds enough to condemn this Rebecca for sorcery?&mdash;Will
      not the Grand Master change his mind when he sees that the proofs are so
      weak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be strengthened, Albert,&rdquo; replied Mont-Fitchet, &ldquo;they must be
      strengthened. Dost thou understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the Preceptor, &ldquo;nor do I scruple to do aught for advancement
      of the Order&mdash;but there is little time to find engines fitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malvoisin, they MUST be found,&rdquo; said Conrade; &ldquo;well will it advantage
      both the Order and thee. This Templestowe is a poor Preceptory&mdash;that
      of Maison-Dieu is worth double its value&mdash;thou knowest my interest
      with our old Chief&mdash;find those who can carry this matter through, and
      thou art Preceptor of Maison-Dieu in the fertile Kent&mdash;How sayst
      thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; replied Malvoisin, &ldquo;among those who came hither with
      Bois-Guilbert, two fellows whom I well know; servants they were to my
      brother Philip de Malvoisin, and passed from his service to that of
      Front-de-Boeuf&mdash;It may be they know something of the witcheries of
      this woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away, seek them out instantly&mdash;and hark thee, if a byzant or two
      will sharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin,&rdquo;
       said the Preceptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away, then,&rdquo; said Mont-Fitchet; &ldquo;at noon the affair will proceed. I have
      not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he condemned to the
      stake Hamet Alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the Moslem faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when Rebecca heard
      a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place of
      confinement. The noise announced the arrival of several persons, and the
      circumstance rather gave her joy; for she was more afraid of the solitary
      visits of the fierce and passionate Bois-Guilbert than of any evil that
      could befall her besides. The door of the chamber was unlocked, and
      Conrade and the Preceptor Malvoisin entered, attended by four warders
      clothed in black, and bearing halberds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daughter of an accursed race!&rdquo; said the Preceptor, &ldquo;arise and follow us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;and for what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; answered Conrade, &ldquo;it is not for thee to question, but to obey.
      Nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to be brought before the
      tribunal of the Grand Master of our holy Order, there to answer for thine
      offences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the God of Abraham be praised!&rdquo; said Rebecca, folding her hands
      devoutly; &ldquo;the name of a judge, though an enemy to my people, is to me as
      the name of a protector. Most willingly do I follow thee&mdash;permit me
      only to wrap my veil around my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long
      gallery, and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end, entered the
      great hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his
      court of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and yeomen,
      who made way not without some difficulty for Rebecca, attended by the
      Preceptor and Mont-Fitchet, and followed by the guard of halberdiers, to
      move forward to the seat appointed for her. As she passed through the
      crowd, her arms folded and her head depressed, a scrap of paper was thrust
      into her hand, which she received almost unconsciously, and continued to
      hold without examining its contents. The assurance that she possessed some
      friend in this awful assembly gave her courage to look around, and to mark
      into whose presence she had been conducted. She gazed, accordingly, upon
      the scene, which we shall endeavour to describe in the next chapter.

      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Stern was the law which bade its vot'ries leave
     At human woes with human hearts to grieve;
     Stern was the law, which at the winning wile
     Of frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile;
     But sterner still, when high the iron-rod
     Of tyrant power she shook, and call'd that power of God.
     &mdash;The Middle Ages
</pre>
    <p>
      The Tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy Rebecca,
      occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the great hall&mdash;a
      platform, which we have already described as the place of honour, destined
      to be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants or guests of an
      ancient mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the Grand Master of
      the Temple, in full and ample robes of flowing white, holding in his hand
      the mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the Order. At his feet was
      placed a table, occupied by two scribes, chaplains of the Order, whose
      duty it was to reduce to formal record the proceedings of the day. The
      black dresses, bare scalps, and demure looks of these church-men, formed a
      strong contrast to the warlike appearance of the knights who attended,
      either as residing in the Preceptory, or as come thither to attend upon
      their Grand Master. The Preceptors, of whom there were four present,
      occupied seats lower in height, and somewhat drawn back behind that of
      their superior; and the knights, who enjoyed no such rank in the Order,
      were placed on benches still lower, and preserving the same distance from
      the Preceptors as these from the Grand Master. Behind them, but still upon
      the dais or elevated portion of the hall, stood the esquires of the Order,
      in white dresses of an inferior quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity; and in the
      faces of the knights might be perceived traces of military daring, united
      with the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession, and
      which, in the presence of their Grand Master, failed not to sit upon every
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining and lower part of the hall was filled with guards, holding
      partisans, and with other attendants whom curiosity had drawn thither, to
      see at once a Grand Master and a Jewish sorceress. By far the greater part
      of those inferior persons were, in one rank or other, connected with the
      Order, and were accordingly distinguished by their black dresses. But
      peasants from the neighbouring country were not refused admittance; for it
      was the pride of Beaumanoir to render the edifying spectacle of the
      justice which he administered as public as possible. His large blue eyes
      seemed to expand as he gazed around the assembly, and his countenance
      appeared elated by the conscious dignity, and imaginary merit, of the part
      which he was about to perform. A psalm, which he himself accompanied with
      a deep mellow voice, which age had not deprived of its powers, commenced
      the proceedings of the day; and the solemn sounds, &ldquo;Venite exultemus
      Domino&rdquo;, so often sung by the Templars before engaging with earthly
      adversaries, was judged by Lucas most appropriate to introduce the
      approaching triumph, for such he deemed it, over the powers of darkness.
      The deep prolonged notes, raised by a hundred masculine voices accustomed
      to combine in the choral chant, arose to the vaulted roof of the hall, and
      rolled on amongst its arches with the pleasing yet solemn sound of the
      rushing of mighty waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sounds ceased, the Grand Master glanced his eye slowly around the
      circle, and observed that the seat of one of the Preceptors was vacant.
      Brian de Bois-Guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left his place,
      and was now standing near the extreme corner of one of the benches
      occupied by the Knights Companions of the Temple, one hand extending his
      long mantle, so as in some degree to hide his face; while the other held
      his cross-handled sword, with the point of which, sheathed as it was, he
      was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy man!&rdquo; said the Grand Master, after favouring him with a glance of
      compassion. &ldquo;Thou seest, Conrade, how this holy work distresses him. To
      this can the light look of woman, aided by the Prince of the Powers of
      this world, bring a valiant and worthy knight!&mdash;Seest thou he cannot
      look upon us; he cannot look upon her; and who knows by what impulse from
      his tormentor his hand forms these cabalistic lines upon the floor?&mdash;It
      may be our life and safety are thus aimed at; but we spit at and defy the
      foul enemy. 'Semper Leo percutiatur!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was communicated apart to his confidential follower, Conrade
      Mont-Fitchet. The Grand Master then raised his voice, and addressed the
      assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend and valiant men, Knights, Preceptors, and Companions of this
      Holy Order, my brethren and my children!&mdash;you also, well-born and
      pious Esquires, who aspire to wear this holy Cross!&mdash;and you also,
      Christian brethren, of every degree!&mdash;Be it known to you, that it is
      not defect of power in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this
      congregation; for, however unworthy in our person, yet to us is committed,
      with this batoon, full power to judge and to try all that regards the weal
      of this our Holy Order. Holy Saint Bernard, in the rule of our knightly
      and religious profession, hath said, in the fifty-ninth capital, <a
      href="#linknote-53" name="linknoteref-53" id="linknoteref-53"><small>53</small></a>
      that he would not that brethren be called together in council, save at the
      will and command of the Master; leaving it free to us, as to those more
      worthy fathers who have preceded us in this our office, to judge, as well
      of the occasion as of the time and place in which a chapter of the whole
      Order, or of any part thereof, may be convoked. Also, in all such
      chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and to
      proceed according to our own pleasure. But when the raging wolf hath made
      an inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it is the
      duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with bows
      and slings they may quell the invader, according to our well-known rule,
      that the lion is ever to be beaten down. We have therefore summoned to our
      presence a Jewish woman, by name Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York&mdash;a
      woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries; whereby she hath
      maddened the blood, and besotted the brain, not of a churl, but of a
      Knight&mdash;not of a secular Knight, but of one devoted to the service of
      the Holy Temple&mdash;not of a Knight Companion, but of a Preceptor of our
      Order, first in honour as in place. Our brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
      is well known to ourselves, and to all degrees who now hear me, as a true
      and zealous champion of the Cross, by whose arm many deeds of valour have
      been wrought in the Holy Land, and the holy places purified from pollution
      by the blood of those infidels who defiled them. Neither have our
      brother's sagacity and prudence been less in repute among his brethren
      than his valour and discipline; in so much, that knights, both in eastern
      and western lands, have named De Bois-Guilbert as one who may well be put
      in nomination as successor to this batoon, when it shall please Heaven to
      release us from the toil of bearing it. If we were told that such a man,
      so honoured, and so honourable, suddenly casting away regard for his
      character, his vows, his brethren, and his prospects, had associated to
      himself a Jewish damsel, wandered in this lewd company, through solitary
      places, defended her person in preference to his own, and, finally, was so
      utterly blinded and besotted by his folly, as to bring her even to one of
      our own Preceptories, what should we say but that the noble knight was
      possessed by some evil demon, or influenced by some wicked spell?&mdash;If
      we could suppose it otherwise, think not rank, valour, high repute, or any
      earthly consideration, should prevent us from visiting him with
      punishment, that the evil thing might be removed, even according to the
      text, 'Auferte malum ex vobis'. For various and heinous are the acts of
      transgression against the rule of our blessed Order in this lamentable
      history.&mdash;1st, He hath walked according to his proper will, contrary
      to capital 33, 'Quod nullus juxta propriam voluntatem incedat'.&mdash;2d,
      He hath held communication with an excommunicated person, capital 57, 'Ut
      fratres non participent cum excommunicatis', and therefore hath a portion
      in 'Anathema Maranatha'.&mdash;3d, He hath conversed with strange women,
      contrary to the capital, 'Ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis
      mulieribus'.&mdash;4th, He hath not avoided, nay, he hath, it is to be
      feared, solicited the kiss of woman; by which, saith the last rule of our
      renowned Order, 'Ut fugiantur oscula', the soldiers of the Cross are
      brought into a snare. For which heinous and multiplied guilt, Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert should be cut off and cast out from our congregation, were
      he the right hand and right eye thereof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. A low murmur went through the assembly. Some of the younger
      part, who had been inclined to smile at the statute 'De osculis
      fugiendis', became now grave enough, and anxiously waited what the Grand
      Master was next to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and so great should indeed be the punishment of a Knight
      Templar, who wilfully offended against the rules of his Order in such
      weighty points. But if, by means of charms and of spells, Satan had
      obtained dominion over the Knight, perchance because he cast his eyes too
      lightly upon a damsel's beauty, we are then rather to lament than chastise
      his backsliding; and, imposing on him only such penance as may purify him
      from his iniquity, we are to turn the full edge of our indignation upon
      the accursed instrument, which had so well-nigh occasioned his utter
      falling away.&mdash;Stand forth, therefore, and bear witness, ye who have
      witnessed these unhappy doings, that we may judge of the sum and bearing
      thereof; and judge whether our justice may be satisfied with the
      punishment of this infidel woman, or if we must go on, with a bleeding
      heart, to the further proceeding against our brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which
      Bois-Guilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save Rebecca from the
      blazing castle, and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to
      her safety. The men gave these details with the exaggerations common to
      vulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event, and
      their natural disposition to the marvellous was greatly increased by the
      satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the eminent person
      for whose information it had been delivered. Thus the dangers which
      Bois-Guilbert surmounted, in themselves sufficiently great, became
      portentous in their narrative. The devotion of the Knight to Rebecca's
      defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only of discretion, but
      even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and his deference to
      what she said, even although her language was often severe and upbraiding,
      was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a man of his haughty
      temper, seemed almost preternatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Preceptor of Templestowe was then called on to describe the manner in
      which Bois-Guilbert and the Jewess arrived at the Preceptory. The evidence
      of Malvoisin was skilfully guarded. But while he apparently studied to
      spare the feelings of Bois-Guilbert, he threw in, from time to time, such
      hints, as seemed to infer that he laboured under some temporary alienation
      of mind, so deeply did he appear to be enamoured of the damsel whom he
      brought along with him. With sighs of penitence, the Preceptor avowed his
      own contrition for having admitted Rebecca and her lover within the walls
      of the Preceptory&mdash;&ldquo;But my defence,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;has been made in
      my confession to our most reverend father the Grand Master; he knows my
      motives were not evil, though my conduct may have been irregular. Joyfully
      will I submit to any penance he shall assign me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast spoken well, Brother Albert,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir; &ldquo;thy motives
      were good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine erring brother
      in his career of precipitate folly. But thy conduct was wrong; as he that
      would stop a runaway steed, and seizing by the stirrup instead of the
      bridle, receiveth injury himself, instead of accomplishing his purpose.
      Thirteen paternosters are assigned by our pious founder for matins, and
      nine for vespers; be those services doubled by thee. Thrice a-week are
      Templars permitted the use of flesh; but do thou keep fast for all the
      seven days. This do for six weeks to come, and thy penance is
      accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a hypocritical look of the deepest submission, the Preceptor of
      Templestowe bowed to the ground before his Superior, and resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it not well, brethren,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;that we examine
      something into the former life and conversation of this woman, specially
      that we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical charms and
      spells, since the truths which we have heard may well incline us to
      suppose, that in this unhappy course our erring brother has been acted
      upon by some infernal enticement and delusion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman of Goodalricke was the Fourth Preceptor present; the other three
      were Conrade, Malvoisin, and Bois-Guilbert himself. Herman was an ancient
      warrior, whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the sabre of the
      Moslemah, and had great rank and consideration among his brethren. He
      arose and bowed to the Grand Master, who instantly granted him license of
      speech. &ldquo;I would crave to know, most Reverend Father, of our valiant
      brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, what he says to these wondrous
      accusations, and with what eye he himself now regards his unhappy
      intercourse with this Jewish maiden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brian de Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;thou hearest the
      question which our Brother of Goodalricke desirest thou shouldst answer. I
      command thee to reply to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bois-Guilbert turned his head towards the Grand Master when thus
      addressed, and remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is possessed by a dumb devil,&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;Avoid thee,
      Sathanus!&mdash;Speak, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, I conjure thee, by this
      symbol of our Holy Order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bois-Guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and indignation,
      the expression of which, he was well aware, would have little availed him.
      &ldquo;Brian de Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;replies not, most Reverend Father,
      to such wild and vague charges. If his honour be impeached, he will defend
      it with his body, and with that sword which has often fought for
      Christendom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We forgive thee, Brother Brian,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;though that thou
      hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us, is a glorifying of thine
      own deeds, and cometh of the Enemy, who tempteth us to exalt our own
      worship. But thou hast our pardon, judging thou speakest less of thine own
      suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by Heaven's leave, we will
      quell and drive forth from our assembly.&rdquo; A glance of disdain flashed from
      the dark fierce eyes of Bois-Guilbert, but he made no reply.&mdash;&ldquo;And
      now,&rdquo; pursued the Grand Master, &ldquo;since our Brother of Goodalricke's
      question has been thus imperfectly answered, pursue we our quest,
      brethren, and with our patron's assistance, we will search to the bottom
      this mystery of iniquity.&mdash;Let those who have aught to witness of the
      life and conversation of this Jewish woman, stand forth before us.&rdquo; There
      was a bustle in the lower part of the hall, and when the Grand Master
      enquired the reason, it was replied, there was in the crowd a bedridden
      man, whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect use of his limbs, by a
      miraculous balsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor peasant, a Saxon by birth, was dragged forward to the bar,
      terrified at the penal consequences which he might have incurred by the
      guilt of having been cured of the palsy by a Jewish damsel. Perfectly
      cured he certainly was not, for he supported himself forward on crutches
      to give evidence. Most unwilling was his testimony, and given with many
      tears; but he admitted that two years since, when residing at York, he was
      suddenly afflicted with a sore disease, while labouring for Isaac the rich
      Jew, in his vocation of a joiner; that he had been unable to stir from his
      bed until the remedies applied by Rebecca's directions, and especially a
      warming and spicy-smelling balsam, had in some degree restored him to the
      use of his limbs. Moreover, he said, she had given him a pot of that
      precious ointment, and furnished him with a piece of money withal, to
      return to the house of his father, near to Templestowe. &ldquo;And may it please
      your gracious Reverence,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I cannot think the damsel meant
      harm by me, though she hath the ill hap to be a Jewess; for even when I
      used her remedy, I said the Pater and the Creed, and it never operated a
      whit less kindly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, slave,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;and begone! It well suits brutes
      like thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures, and to be
      giving your labour to the sons of mischief. I tell thee, the fiend can
      impose diseases for the very purpose of removing them, in order to bring
      into credit some diabolical fashion of cure. Hast thou that unguent of
      which thou speakest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant, fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand, produced a small
      box, bearing some Hebrew characters on the lid, which was, with most of
      the audience, a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary.
      Beaumanoir, after crossing himself, took the box into his hand, and,
      learned in most of the Eastern tongues, read with ease the motto on the
      lid,&mdash;&ldquo;The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange powers of Sathanas.&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which can convert Scripture into
      blasphemy, mingling poison with our necessary food!&mdash;Is there no
      leech here who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic unguent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two mediciners, as they called themselves, the one a monk, the other a
      barber, appeared, and avouched they knew nothing of the materials,
      excepting that they savoured of myrrh and camphire, which they took to be
      Oriental herbs. But with the true professional hatred to a successful
      practitioner of their art, they insinuated that, since the medicine was
      beyond their own knowledge, it must necessarily have been compounded from
      an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia; since they themselves, though no
      conjurors, fully understood every branch of their art, so far as it might
      be exercised with the good faith of a Christian. When this medical
      research was ended, the Saxon peasant desired humbly to have back the
      medicine which he had found so salutary; but the Grand Master frowned
      severely at the request. &ldquo;What is thy name, fellow?&rdquo; said he to the
      cripple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Higg, the son of Snell,&rdquo; answered the peasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Higg, son of Snell,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;I tell thee it is
      better to be bedridden, than to accept the benefit of unbelievers'
      medicine that thou mayest arise and walk; better to despoil infidels of
      their treasure by the strong hand, than to accept of them benevolent
      gifts, or do them service for wages. Go thou, and do as I have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alack,&rdquo; said the peasant, &ldquo;an it shall not displease your Reverence, the
      lesson comes too late for me, for I am but a maimed man; but I will tell
      my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that your
      mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him faithful
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with the prating villain!&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, who was not prepared to
      refute this practical application of his general maxim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higg, the son of Snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the
      fate of his benefactress, lingered until he should learn her doom, even at
      the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the terror
      of which withered his very heart within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period of the trial, the Grand Master commanded Rebecca to unveil
      herself. Opening her lips for the first time, she replied patiently, but
      with dignity,&mdash;&ldquo;That it was not the wont of the daughters of her
      people to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of strangers.&rdquo; The
      sweet tones of her voice, and the softness of her reply, impressed on the
      audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy. But Beaumanoir, in whose mind
      the suppression of each feeling of humanity which could interfere with his
      imagined duty, was a virtue of itself, repeated his commands that his
      victim should be unveiled. The guards were about to remove her veil
      accordingly, when she stood up before the Grand Master and said, &ldquo;Nay, but
      for the love of your own daughters&mdash;Alas,&rdquo; she said, recollecting
      herself, &ldquo;ye have no daughters!&mdash;yet for the remembrance of your
      mothers&mdash;for the love of your sisters, and of female decency, let me
      not be thus handled in your presence; it suits not a maiden to be disrobed
      by such rude grooms. I will obey you,&rdquo; she added, with an expression of
      patient sorrow in her voice, which had almost melted the heart of
      Beaumanoir himself; &ldquo;ye are elders among your people, and at your command
      I will show the features of an ill-fated maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her veil, and looked on them with a countenance in which
      bashfulness contended with dignity. Her exceeding beauty excited a murmur
      of surprise, and the younger knights told each other with their eyes, in
      silent correspondence, that Brian's best apology was in the power of her
      real charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. But Higg, the son of
      Snell, felt most deeply the effect produced by the sight of the
      countenance of his benefactress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go forth,&rdquo; he said to the warders at the door of the hall,&mdash;&ldquo;let
      me go forth!&mdash;To look at her again will kill me, for I have had a
      share in murdering her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, poor man,&rdquo; said Rebecca, when she heard his exclamation; &ldquo;thou
      hast done me no harm by speaking the truth&mdash;thou canst not aid me by
      thy complaints or lamentations. Peace, I pray thee&mdash;go home and save
      thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Higg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders, who were
      apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them reprehension,
      and upon himself punishment. But he promised to be silent, and was
      permitted to remain. The two men-at-arms, with whom Albert Malvoisin had
      not failed to communicate upon the import of their testimony, were now
      called forward. Though both were hardened and inflexible villains, the
      sight of the captive maiden, as well as her excelling beauty, at first
      appeared to stagger them; but an expressive glance from the Preceptor of
      Templestowe restored them to their dogged composure; and they delivered,
      with a precision which would have seemed suspicious to more impartial
      judges, circumstances either altogether fictitious or trivial, and natural
      in themselves, but rendered pregnant with suspicion by the exaggerated
      manner in which they were told, and the sinister commentary which the
      witnesses added to the facts. The circumstances of their evidence would
      have been, in modern days, divided into two classes&mdash;those which were
      immaterial, and those which were actually and physically impossible. But
      both were, in those ignorant and superstitions times, easily credited as
      proofs of guilt.&mdash;The first class set forth, that Rebecca was heard
      to mutter to herself in an unknown tongue&mdash;that the songs she sung by
      fits were of a strangely sweet sound, which made the ears of the hearer
      tingle, and his heart throb&mdash;that she spoke at times to herself, and
      seemed to look upward for a reply&mdash;that her garments were of a
      strange and mystic form, unlike those of women of good repute&mdash;that
      she had rings impressed with cabalistical devices, and that strange
      characters were broidered on her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these circumstances, so natural and so trivial, were gravely listened
      to as proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions that Rebecca
      had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of the
      assembly, or of the greater part, greedily swallowed, however incredible.
      One of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded man, brought
      with them to the castle of Torquilstone. She did, he said, make certain
      signs upon the wound, and repeated certain mysterious words, which he
      blessed God he understood not, when the iron head of a square cross-bow
      bolt disengaged itself from the wound, the bleeding was stanched, the
      wound was closed, and the dying man was, within a quarter of an hour,
      walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the witness in managing a
      mangonel, or machine for hurling stones. This legend was probably founded
      upon the fact, that Rebecca had attended on the wounded Ivanhoe when in
      the castle of Torquilstone. But it was the more difficult to dispute the
      accuracy of the witness, as, in order to produce real evidence in support
      of his verbal testimony, he drew from his pouch the very bolt-head, which,
      according to his story, had been miraculously extracted from the wound;
      and as the iron weighed a full ounce, it completely confirmed the tale,
      however marvellous.
    </p>
    <p>
      His comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the scene
      betwixt Rebecca and Bois-Guilbert, when she was upon the point of
      precipitating herself from the top of the tower. Not to be behind his
      companion, this fellow stated, that he had seen Rebecca perch herself upon
      the parapet of the turret, and there take the form of a milk-white swan,
      under which appearance she flitted three times round the castle of
      Torquilstone; then again settle on the turret, and once more assume the
      female form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient to
      convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though she had not been a
      Jewess. United with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too
      weighty for Rebecca's youth, though combined with the most exquisite
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn tone
      demanded of Rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of
      condemnation, which he was about to pronounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To invoke your pity,&rdquo; said the lovely Jewess, with a voice somewhat
      tremulous with emotion, &ldquo;would, I am aware, be as useless as I should hold
      it mean. To state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another
      religion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged Founder of both our
      faiths, were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men
      (whom may Heaven pardon!) have spoken against me are impossible, would
      avail me but little, since you believe in their possibility; and still
      less would it advantage me to explain, that the peculiarities of my dress,
      language, and manners, are those of my people&mdash;I had well-nigh said
      of my country, but alas! we have no country. Nor will I even vindicate
      myself at the expense of my oppressor, who stands there listening to the
      fictions and surmises which seem to convert the tyrant into the victim.&mdash;God
      be judge between him and me! but rather would I submit to ten such deaths
      as your pleasure may denounce against me, than listen to the suit which
      that man of Belial has urged upon me&mdash;friendless, defenceless, and
      his prisoner. But he is of your own faith, and his lightest affirmance
      would weigh down the most solemn protestations of the distressed Jewess. I
      will not therefore return to himself the charge brought against me&mdash;but
      to himself&mdash;Yes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, to thyself I appeal, whether
      these accusations are not false? as monstrous and calumnious as they are
      deadly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; all eyes turned to Brain de Bois-Guilbert. He was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if thou art a man&mdash;if thou art a Christian,
      speak!&mdash;I conjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear, by the
      name thou dost inherit&mdash;by the knighthood thou dost vaunt&mdash;by
      the honour of thy mother&mdash;by the tomb and the bones of thy father&mdash;I
      conjure thee to say, are these things true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer her, brother,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;if the Enemy with whom thou
      dost wrestle will give thee power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Bois-Guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which
      almost convulsed his features, and it was with a constrained voice that at
      last he replied, looking to Rebecca,&mdash;&ldquo;The scroll!&mdash;the scroll!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, &ldquo;this is indeed testimony! The victim of her
      witcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed on which
      is, doubtless, the cause of his silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were
      from Bois-Guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment which
      she continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in the
      Arabian character, &ldquo;Demand a Champion!&rdquo; The murmuring commentary which ran
      through the assembly at the strange reply of Bois-Guilbert, gave Rebecca
      leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll unobserved. When
      the whisper had ceased, the Grand Master spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca, thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this unhappy
      knight, for whom, as we well perceive, the Enemy is yet too powerful. Hast
      thou aught else to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is yet one chance of life left to me,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;even by your
      own fierce laws. Life has been miserable&mdash;miserable, at least, of
      late&mdash;but I will not cast away the gift of God, while he affords me
      the means of defending it. I deny this charge&mdash;I maintain my
      innocence, and I declare the falsehood of this accusation&mdash;I
      challenge the privilege of trial by combat, and will appear by my
      champion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who, Rebecca,&rdquo; replied the Grand Master, &ldquo;will lay lance in rest for
      a sorceress? who will be the champion of a Jewess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God will raise me up a champion,&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;It cannot be that
      in merry England&mdash;the hospitable, the generous, the free, where so
      many are ready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be found
      one to fight for justice. But it is enough that I challenge the trial by
      combat&mdash;there lies my gage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before the
      Grand Master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which excited
      universal surprise and admiration.

     To prove it on thee to the extremest point
     Of martial daring.
     &mdash;Richard II
</pre>
    <p>
      Even Lucas Beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance of
      Rebecca. He was not originally a cruel or even a severe man; but with
      passions by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense of duty,
      his heart had been gradually hardened by the ascetic life which he
      pursued, the supreme power which he enjoyed, and the supposed necessity of
      subduing infidelity and eradicating heresy, which he conceived peculiarly
      incumbent on him. His features relaxed in their usual severity as he gazed
      upon the beautiful creature before him, alone, unfriended, and defending
      herself with so much spirit and courage. He crossed himself twice, as
      doubting whence arose the unwonted softening of a heart, which on such
      occasions used to resemble in hardness the steel of his sword. At length
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if the pity I feel for thee arise from any practice
      thine evil arts have made on me, great is thy guilt. But I rather judge it
      the kinder feelings of nature, which grieves that so goodly a form should
      be a vessel of perdition. Repent, my daughter&mdash;confess thy
      witchcrafts&mdash;turn thee from thine evil faith&mdash;embrace this holy
      emblem, and all shall yet be well with thee here and hereafter. In some
      sisterhood of the strictest order, shalt thou have time for prayer and
      fitting penance, and that repentance not to be repented of. This do and
      live&mdash;what has the law of Moses done for thee that thou shouldest die
      for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the law of my fathers,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;it was delivered in
      thunders and in storms upon the mountain of Sinai, in cloud and in fire.
      This, if ye are Christians, ye believe&mdash;it is, you say, recalled; but
      so my teachers have not taught me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let our chaplain,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, &ldquo;stand forth, and tell this obstinate
      infidel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive the interruption,&rdquo; said Rebecca, meekly; &ldquo;I am a maiden,
      unskilled to dispute for my religion, but I can die for it, if it be God's
      will.&mdash;Let me pray your answer to my demand of a champion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me her glove,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir. &ldquo;This is indeed,&rdquo; he continued, as
      he looked at the flimsy texture and slender fingers, &ldquo;a slight and frail
      gage for a purpose so deadly!&mdash;Seest thou, Rebecca, as this thin and
      light glove of thine is to one of our heavy steel gauntlets, so is thy
      cause to that of the Temple, for it is our Order which thou hast defied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast my innocence into the scale,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;and the glove of
      silk shall outweigh the glove of iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt, and in that
      bold challenge which thou hast made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do persist, noble sir,&rdquo; answered Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it then, in the name of Heaven,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;and may
      God show the right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; replied the Preceptors around him, and the word was deeply echoed
      by the whole assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; said Beaumanoir, &ldquo;you are aware that we might well have
      refused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combat&mdash;but though
      a Jewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and
      God forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws, and that it
      should be refused to her. Moreover, we are knights and soldiers as well as
      men of religion, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to refuse
      proffered combat. Thus, therefore, stands the case. Rebecca, the daughter
      of Isaac of York, is, by many frequent and suspicious circumstances,
      defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble knight of our holy
      Order, and hath challenged the combat in proof of her innocence. To whom,
      reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we should deliver the gage of
      battle, naming him, at the same time, to be our champion on the field?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom it chiefly concerns,&rdquo; said the Preceptor
      of Goodalricke, &ldquo;and who, moreover, best knows how the truth stands in
      this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;our brother Brian be under the influence
      of a charm or a spell&mdash;we speak but for the sake of precaution, for
      to the arm of none of our holy Order would we more willingly confide this
      or a more weighty cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; answered the Preceptor of Goodalricke, &ldquo;no spell can
      effect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou sayest right, brother,&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;Albert Malvoisin,
      give this gage of battle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert.&mdash;It is our charge
      to thee, brother,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself to Bois-Guilbert,
      &ldquo;that thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that the good cause
      shall triumph.&mdash;And do thou, Rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the
      third day from the present to find a champion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is but brief space,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;for a stranger, who is also
      of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life and honour
      for her cause, against a knight who is called an approved soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may not extend it,&rdquo; answered the Grand Master; &ldquo;the field must be
      foughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causes call us on the
      fourth day from hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's will be done!&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;I put my trust in Him, to whom an
      instant is as effectual to save as a whole age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast spoken well, damsel,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;but well know we
      who can array himself like an angel of light. It remains but to name a
      fitting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of execution.&mdash;Where
      is the Preceptor of this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert Malvoisin, still holding Rebecca's glove in his hand, was speaking
      to Bois-Guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;will he not receive the gage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will&mdash;he doth, most Reverend Father,&rdquo; said Malvoisin, slipping
      the glove under his own mantle. &ldquo;And for the place of combat, I hold the
      fittest to be the lists of Saint George belonging to this Preceptory, and
      used by us for military exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the Grand Master.&mdash;&ldquo;Rebecca, in those lists shalt
      thou produce thy champion; and if thou failest to do so, or if thy
      champion shall be discomfited by the judgment of God, thou shalt then die
      the death of a sorceress, according to doom.&mdash;Let this our judgment
      be recorded, and the record read aloud, that no one may pretend
      ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately
      engrossed the order in a huge volume, which contained the proceedings of
      the Templar Knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and when he
      had finished writing, the other read aloud the sentence of the Grand
      Master, which, when translated from the Norman-French in which it was
      couched, was expressed as follows.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca, a Jewess, daughter of Isaac of York, being attainted of sorcery,
      seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on a Knight of the most
      Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, doth deny the same; and saith, that the
      testimony delivered against her this day is false, wicked, and disloyal;
      and that by lawful 'essoine' <a href="#linknote-54" name="linknoteref-54"       id="linknoteref-54"><small>54</small></a> of her body as being unable to
      combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion instead thereof,
      to avouch her case, he performing his loyal 'devoir' in all knightly sort,
      with such arms as to gage of battle do fully appertain, and that at her
      peril and cost. And therewith she proffered her gage. And the gage having
      been delivered to the noble Lord and Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, of
      the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, he was appointed to do this battle,
      in behalf of his Order and himself, as injured and impaired by the
      practices of the appellant. Wherefore the most reverend Father and
      puissant Lord, Lucas Marquis of Beaumanoir, did allow of the said
      challenge, and of the said 'essoine' of the appellant's body, and assigned
      the third day for the said combat, the place being the enclosure called
      the lists of Saint George, near to the Preceptory of Templestowe. And the
      Grand Master appoints the appellant to appear there by her champion, on
      pain of doom, as a person convicted of sorcery or seduction; and also the
      defendant so to appear, under the penalty of being held and adjudged
      recreant in case of default; and the noble Lord and most reverend Father
      aforesaid appointed the battle to be done in his own presence, and
      according to all that is commendable and profitable in such a case. And
      may God aid the just cause!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said the Grand Master; and the word was echoed by all around.
      Rebecca spoke not, but she looked up to heaven, and, folding her hands,
      remained for a minute without change of attitude. She then modestly
      reminded the Grand Master, that she ought to be permitted some opportunity
      of free communication with her friends, for the purpose of making her
      condition known to them, and procuring, if possible, some champion to
      fight in her behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just and lawful,&rdquo; said the Grand Master; &ldquo;choose what messenger
      thou shalt trust, and he shall have free communication with thee in thy
      prison-chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;any one here, who, either for love of a good
      cause, or for ample hire, will do the errand of a distressed being?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All were silent; for none thought it safe, in the presence of the Grand
      Master, to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner, lest he should
      be suspected of leaning towards Judaism. Not even the prospect of reward,
      far less any feelings of compassion alone, could surmount this
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety, and then
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Is it really thus?&mdash;And, in English land, am I to be
      deprived of the poor chance of safety which remains to me, for want of an
      act of charity which would not be refused to the worst criminal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Higg, the son of Snell, at length replied, &ldquo;I am but a maimed man, but
      that I can at all stir or move was owing to her charitable assistance.&mdash;I
      will do thine errand,&rdquo; he added, addressing Rebecca, &ldquo;as well as a
      crippled object can, and happy were my limbs fleet enough to repair the
      mischief done by my tongue. Alas! when I boasted of thy charity, I little
      thought I was leading thee into danger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;is the disposer of all. He can turn back the
      captivity of Judah, even by the weakest instrument. To execute his message
      the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. Seek out Isaac of York&mdash;here
      is that will pay for horse and man&mdash;let him have this scroll.&mdash;I
      know not if it be of Heaven the spirit which inspires me, but most truly
      do I judge that I am not to die this death, and that a champion will be
      raised up for me. Farewell!&mdash;Life and death are in thy haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant took the scroll, which contained only a few lines in Hebrew.
      Many of the crowd would have dissuaded him from touching a document so
      suspicious; but Higg was resolute in the service of his benefactress. She
      had saved his body, he said, and he was confident she did not mean to
      peril his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will get me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my neighbour Buthan's good capul, <a
      href="#linknote-55" name="linknoteref-55" id="linknoteref-55"><small>55</small></a>
      and I will be at York within as brief space as man and beast may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as it fortuned, he had no occasion to go so far, for within a quarter
      of a mile from the gate of the Preceptory he met with two riders, whom, by
      their dress and their huge yellow caps, he knew to be Jews; and, on
      approaching more nearly, discovered that one of them was his ancient
      employer, Isaac of York. The other was the Rabbi Ben Samuel; and both had
      approached as near to the Preceptory as they dared, on hearing that the
      Grand Master had summoned a chapter for the trial of a sorceress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Ben Samuel,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;my soul is disquieted, and I wot not
      why. This charge of necromancy is right often used for cloaking evil
      practices on our people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be of good comfort, brother,&rdquo; said the physician; &ldquo;thou canst deal with
      the Nazarenes as one possessing the mammon of unrighteousness, and canst
      therefore purchase immunity at their hands&mdash;it rules the savage minds
      of those ungodly men, even as the signet of the mighty Solomon was said to
      command the evil genii.&mdash;But what poor wretch comes hither upon his
      crutches, desiring, as I think, some speech of me?&mdash;Friend,&rdquo;
       continued the physician, addressing Higg, the son of Snell, &ldquo;I refuse thee
      not the aid of mine art, but I relieve not with one asper those who beg
      for alms upon the highway. Out upon thee!&mdash;Hast thou the palsy in thy
      legs? then let thy hands work for thy livelihood; for, albeit thou be'st
      unfit for a speedy post, or for a careful shepherd, or for the warfare, or
      for the service of a hasty master, yet there be occupations&mdash;How now,
      brother?&rdquo; said he, interrupting his harangue to look towards Isaac, who
      had but glanced at the scroll which Higg offered, when, uttering a deep
      groan, he fell from his mule like a dying man, and lay for a minute
      insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rabbi now dismounted in great alarm, and hastily applied the remedies
      which his art suggested for the recovery of his companion. He had even
      taken from his pocket a cupping apparatus, and was about to proceed to
      phlebotomy, when the object of his anxious solicitude suddenly revived;
      but it was to dash his cap from his head, and to throw dust on his grey
      hairs. The physician was at first inclined to ascribe this sudden and
      violent emotion to the effects of insanity; and, adhering to his original
      purpose, began once again to handle his implements. But Isaac soon
      convinced him of his error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child of my sorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;well shouldst thou be called Benoni,
      instead of Rebecca! Why should thy death bring down my grey hairs to the
      grave, till, in the bitterness of my heart, I curse God and die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the Rabbi, in great surprise, &ldquo;art thou a father in
      Israel, and dost thou utter words like unto these?&mdash;I trust that the
      child of thy house yet liveth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She liveth,&rdquo; answered Isaac; &ldquo;but it is as Daniel, who was called
      Beltheshazzar, even when within the den of the lions. She is captive unto
      those men of Belial, and they will wreak their cruelty upon her, sparing
      neither for her youth nor her comely favour. O! she was as a crown of
      green palms to my grey locks; and she must wither in a night, like the
      gourd of Jonah!&mdash;Child of my love!&mdash;child of my old age!&mdash;oh,
      Rebecca, daughter of Rachel! the darkness of the shadow of death hath
      encompassed thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet read the scroll,&rdquo; said the Rabbi; &ldquo;peradventure it may be that we may
      yet find out a way of deliverance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do thou read, brother,&rdquo; answered Isaac, &ldquo;for mine eyes are as a fountain
      of water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician read, but in their native language, the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Isaac, the son of Adonikam, whom the Gentiles call Isaac of York,
      peace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied unto thee!&mdash;My
      father, I am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth not&mdash;even
      for the crime of witchcraft. My father, if a strong man can be found to do
      battle for my cause with sword and spear, according to the custom of the
      Nazarenes, and that within the lists of Templestowe, on the third day from
      this time, peradventure our fathers' God will give him strength to defend
      the innocent, and her who hath none to help her. But if this may not be,
      let the virgins of our people mourn for me as for one cast off, and for
      the hart that is stricken by the hunter, and for the flower which is cut
      down by the scythe of the mower. Wherefore look now what thou doest, and
      whether there be any rescue. One Nazarene warrior might indeed bear arms
      in my behalf, even Wilfred, son of Cedric, whom the Gentiles call Ivanhoe.
      But he may not yet endure the weight of his armour. Nevertheless, send the
      tidings unto him, my father; for he hath favour among the strong men of
      his people, and as he was our companion in the house of bondage, he may
      find some one to do battle for my sake. And say unto him, even unto him,
      even unto Wilfred, the son of Cedric, that if Rebecca live, or if Rebecca
      die, she liveth or dieth wholly free of the guilt she is charged withal.
      And if it be the will of God that thou shalt be deprived of thy daughter,
      do not thou tarry, old man, in this land of bloodshed and cruelty; but
      betake thyself to Cordova, where thy brother liveth in safety, under the
      shadow of the throne, even of the throne of Boabdil the Saracen; for less
      cruel are the cruelties of the Moors unto the race of Jacob, than the
      cruelties of the Nazarenes of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac listened with tolerable composure while Ben Samuel read the letter,
      and then again resumed the gestures and exclamations of Oriental sorrow,
      tearing his garments, besprinkling his head with dust, and ejaculating,
      &ldquo;My daughter! my daughter! flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said the Rabbi, &ldquo;take courage, for this grief availeth nothing.
      Gird up thy loins, and seek out this Wilfred, the son of Cedric. It may be
      he will help thee with counsel or with strength; for the youth hath favour
      in the eyes of Richard, called of the Nazarenes Coeur-de-Lion, and the
      tidings that he hath returned are constant in the land. It may be that he
      may obtain his letter, and his signet, commanding these men of blood, who
      take their name from the Temple to the dishonour thereof, that they
      proceed not in their purposed wickedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will seek him out,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;for he is a good youth, and hath
      compassion for the exile of Jacob. But he cannot bear his armour, and what
      other Christian shall do battle for the oppressed of Zion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said the Rabbi, &ldquo;thou speakest as one that knoweth not the
      Gentiles. With gold shalt thou buy their valour, even as with gold thou
      buyest thine own safety. Be of good courage, and do thou set forward to
      find out this Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I will also up and be doing, for great
      sin it were to leave thee in thy calamity. I will hie me to the city of
      York, where many warriors and strong men are assembled, and doubt not I
      will find among them some one who will do battle for thy daughter; for
      gold is their god, and for riches will they pawn their lives as well as
      their lands.&mdash;Thou wilt fulfil, my brother, such promise as I may
      make unto them in thy name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly, brother,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;and Heaven be praised that raised me up
      a comforter in my misery. Howbeit, grant them not their full demand at
      once, for thou shalt find it the quality of this accursed people that they
      will ask pounds, and peradventure accept of ounces&mdash;Nevertheless, be
      it as thou willest, for I am distracted in this thing, and what would my
      gold avail me if the child of my love should perish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said the physician, &ldquo;and may it be to thee as thy heart
      desireth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They embraced accordingly, and departed on their several roads. The
      crippled peasant remained for some time looking after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These dog-Jews!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;to take no more notice of a free
      guild-brother, than if I were a bond slave or a Turk, or a circumcised Hebrew
      like themselves! They might have flung me a mancus or two, however. I was
      not obliged to bring their unhallowed scrawls, and run the risk of being
      bewitched, as more folks than one told me. And what care I for the bit of
      gold that the wench gave me, if I am to come to harm from the priest next
      Easter at confession, and be obliged to give him twice as much to make it
      up with him, and be called the Jew's flying post all my life, as it may
      hap, into the bargain? I think I was bewitched in earnest when I was
      beside that girl!&mdash;But it was always so with Jew or Gentile,
      whosoever came near her&mdash;none could stay when she had an errand to go&mdash;and
      still, whenever I think of her, I would give shop and tools to save her
      life.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXIX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art,
     My bosom is proud as thine own.
     &mdash;Seward
</pre>
    <p>
      It was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be called
      such, had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door of Rebecca's
      prison-chamber. It disturbed not the inmate, who was then engaged in the
      evening prayer recommended by her religion, and which concluded with a
      hymn we have ventured thus to translate into English.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When Israel, of the Lord beloved,
     Out of the land of bondage came,
     Her father's God before her moved,
     An awful guide, in smoke and flame.
     By day, along the astonish'd lands
     The cloudy pillar glided slow;
     By night, Arabia's crimson'd sands
     Return'd the fiery column's glow.

     There rose the choral hymn of praise,
     And trump and timbrel answer'd keen,
     And Zion's daughters pour'd their lays,
     With priest's and warrior's voice between.
     No portents now our foes amaze,
     Forsaken Israel wanders lone;
     Our fathers would not know THY ways,
     And THOU hast left them to their own.

     But, present still, though now unseen;
     When brightly shines the prosperous day,
     Be thoughts of THEE a cloudy screen
     To temper the deceitful ray.
     And oh, when stoops on Judah's path
     In shade and storm the frequent night,
     Be THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath,
     A burning, and a shining light!

     Our harps we left by Babel's streams,
     The tyrant's jest, the Gentile's scorn;
     No censer round our altar beams,
     And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.
     But THOU hast said, the blood of goat,
     The flesh of rams, I will not prize;
     A contrite heart, and humble thought,
     Are mine accepted sacrifice.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the sounds of Rebecca's devotional hymn had died away in silence, the
      low knock at the door was again renewed. &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if thou art a
      friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, entering the apartment, &ldquo;friend or
      foe, Rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she considered
      as the root of her misfortunes, Rebecca drew backward with a cautious and
      alarmed, yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest corner of the
      apartment, as if determined to retreat as far as she could, but to stand
      her ground when retreat became no longer possible. She drew herself into
      an attitude not of defiance, but of resolution, as one that would avoid
      provoking assault, yet was resolute to repel it, being offered, to the
      utmost of her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no reason to fear me, Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;or if I must
      so qualify my speech, you have at least NOW no reason to fear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you not, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, although her short-drawn
      breath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; &ldquo;my trust is strong,
      and I fear thee not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no cause,&rdquo; answered Bois-Guilbert, gravely; &ldquo;my former frantic
      attempts you have not now to dread. Within your call are guards, over whom
      I have no authority. They are designed to conduct you to death, Rebecca,
      yet would not suffer you to be insulted by any one, even by me, were my
      frenzy&mdash;for frenzy it is&mdash;to urge me so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven be praised!&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;death is the least of my
      apprehensions in this den of evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the Templar, &ldquo;the idea of death is easily received by the
      courageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. A thrust with a
      lance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little&mdash;To you, a spring
      from a dizzy battlement, a stroke with a sharp poniard, has no terrors,
      compared with what either thinks disgrace. Mark me&mdash;I say this&mdash;perhaps
      mine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic, Rebecca, than thine
      are; but we know alike how to die for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy man,&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;and art thou condemned to expose thy life
      for principles, of which thy sober judgment does not acknowledge the
      solidity? Surely this is a parting with your treasure for that which is
      not bread&mdash;but deem not so of me. Thy resolution may fluctuate on the
      wild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is anchored on the
      Rock of Ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, maiden,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;such discourse now avails but
      little. Thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death, such as
      misery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted
      course of torture, suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men
      calls thy crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to whom&mdash;if such my fate&mdash;to whom do I owe this?&rdquo; said
      Rebecca &ldquo;surely only to him, who, for a most selfish and brutal cause,
      dragged me hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own,
      strives to exaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;that I have so exposed thee; I would have
      bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom, as freely as ever I
      exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,&rdquo; said
      Rebecca, &ldquo;I had thanked thee for thy care&mdash;as it is, thou hast
      claimed merit for it so often, that I tell thee life is worth nothing to
      me, preserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truce with thine upbraidings, Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;I have my own
      cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches should add to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is thy purpose, then, Sir Knight?&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;speak it
      briefly.&mdash;If thou hast aught to do, save to witness the misery thou
      hast caused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave me to
      myself&mdash;the step between time and eternity is short but terrible, and
      I have few moments to prepare for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;that thou dost continue to
      burden me with the charge of distresses, which most fain would I have
      prevented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I would avoid reproaches&mdash;But what is
      more certain than that I owe my death to thine unbridled passion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You err&mdash;you err,&rdquo;&mdash;said the Templar, hastily, &ldquo;if you impute
      what I could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agency.&mdash;Could
      I guess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some flashes of frantic
      valour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid self-torments of an
      ascetic, have raised for the present above his own merits, above common
      sense, above me, and above the hundreds of our Order, who think and feel
      as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the grounds of
      his opinions and actions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;you sate a judge upon me, innocent&mdash;most
      innocent&mdash;as you knew me to be&mdash;you concurred in my
      condemnation, and, if I aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms
      to assert my guilt, and assure my punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy patience, maiden,&rdquo; replied the Templar. &ldquo;No race knows so well as
      thine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trim their bark as
      to make advantage even of an adverse wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lamented be the hour,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;that has taught such art to the
      House of Israel! but adversity bends the heart as fire bends the stubborn
      steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and the denizens
      of their own free independent state, must crouch before strangers. It is
      our curse, Sir Knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own misdeeds and those
      of our fathers; but you&mdash;you who boast your freedom as your
      birthright, how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to soothe the
      prejudices of others, and that against your own conviction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words are bitter, Rebecca,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, pacing the apartment
      with impatience, &ldquo;but I came not hither to bandy reproaches with you.&mdash;Know
      that Bois-Guilbert yields not to created man, although circumstances may
      for a time induce him to alter his plan. His will is the mountain stream,
      which may indeed be turned for a little space aside by the rock, but fails
      not to find its course to the ocean. That scroll which warned thee to
      demand a champion, from whom couldst thou think it came, if not from
      Bois-Guilbert? In whom else couldst thou have excited such interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brief respite from instant death,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;which will little
      avail me&mdash;was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose head thou
      hast heaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of
      the tomb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No maiden,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;this was NOT all that I purposed. Had it
      not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical dotard, and the
      fool of Goodalricke, who, being a Templar, affects to think and judge
      according to the ordinary rules of humanity, the office of the Champion
      Defender had devolved, not on a Preceptor, but on a Companion of the
      Order. Then I myself&mdash;such was my purpose&mdash;had, on the sounding
      of the trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed in
      the fashion of a roving knight, who seeks adventures to prove his shield
      and spear; and then, let Beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two or three
      of the brethren here assembled, I had not doubted to cast them out of the
      saddle with my single lance. Thus, Rebecca, should thine innocence have
      been avouched, and to thine own gratitude would I have trusted for the
      reward of my victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;is but idle boasting&mdash;a brag of
      what you would have done had you not found it convenient to do otherwise.
      You received my glove, and my champion, if a creature so desolate can find
      one, must encounter your lance in the lists&mdash;yet you would assume the
      air of my friend and protector!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy friend and protector,&rdquo; said the Templar, gravely, &ldquo;I will yet be&mdash;but
      mark at what risk, or rather at what certainty, of dishonour; and then
      blame me not if I make my stipulations, before I offer up all that I have
      hitherto held dear, to save the life of a Jewish maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;I understand thee not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;I will speak as freely as ever did
      doting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the tricky
      confessional.&mdash;Rebecca, if I appear not in these lists I lose fame
      and rank&mdash;lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, I
      mean, in which I am held by my brethren, and the hopes I have of
      succeeding to that mighty authority, which is now wielded by the bigoted
      dotard Lucas de Beaumanoir, but of which I should make a different use.
      Such is my certain doom, except I appear in arms against thy cause.
      Accursed be he of Goodalricke, who baited this trap for me! and doubly
      accursed Albert de Malvoisin, who withheld me from the resolution I had
      formed, of hurling back the glove at the face of the superstitious and
      superannuated fool, who listened to a charge so absurd, and against a
      creature so high in mind, and so lovely in form as thou art!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what now avails rant or flattery?&rdquo; answered Rebecca. &ldquo;Thou hast made
      thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an innocent woman, or
      of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopes&mdash;What avails
      it to reckon together?&mdash;thy choice is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Rebecca,&rdquo; said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing nearer
      towards her; &ldquo;my choice is NOT made&mdash;nay, mark, it is thine to make
      the election. If I appear in the lists, I must maintain my name in arms;
      and if I do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diest by the stake and
      faggot, for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms on
      equal issue, or on terms of vantage, save Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and his
      minion of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear his
      corslet, and Richard is in a foreign prison. If I appear, then thou diest,
      even although thy charms should instigate some hot-headed youth to enter
      the lists in thy defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what avails repeating this so often?&rdquo; said Rebecca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much,&rdquo; replied the Templar; &ldquo;for thou must learn to look at thy fate on
      every side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, turn the tapestry,&rdquo; said the Jewess, &ldquo;and let me see the
      other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I appear,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert, &ldquo;in the fatal lists, thou diest by a
      slow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to the guilty
      hereafter. But if I appear not, then am I a degraded and dishonoured
      knight, accused of witchcraft and of communion with infidels&mdash;the
      illustrious name which has grown yet more so under my wearing, becomes a
      hissing and a reproach. I lose fame, I lose honour, I lose the prospect of
      such greatness as scarce emperors attain to&mdash;I sacrifice mighty
      ambition, I destroy schemes built as high as the mountains with which
      heathens say their heaven was once nearly scaled&mdash;and yet, Rebecca,&rdquo;
       he added, throwing himself at her feet, &ldquo;this greatness will I sacrifice,
      this fame will I renounce, this power will I forego, even now when it is
      half within my grasp, if thou wilt say, Bois-Guilbert, I receive thee for
      my lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of such foolishness, Sir Knight,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;but hasten
      to the Regent, the Queen Mother, and to Prince John&mdash;they cannot, in
      honour to the English crown, allow of the proceedings of your Grand
      Master. So shall you give me protection without sacrifice on your part, or
      the pretext of requiring any requital from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With these I deal not,&rdquo; he continued, holding the train of her robe&mdash;&ldquo;it
      is thee only I address; and what can counterbalance thy choice? Bethink
      thee, were I a fiend, yet death is a worse, and it is death who is my
      rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I weigh not these evils,&rdquo; said Rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild
      knight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, nor even
      feign to endure it. &ldquo;Be a man, be a Christian! If indeed thy faith
      recommends that mercy which rather your tongues than your actions pretend,
      save me from this dreadful death, without seeking a requital which would
      change thy magnanimity into base barter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, damsel!&rdquo; said the proud Templar, springing up, &ldquo;thou shalt not thus
      impose on me&mdash;if I renounce present fame and future ambition, I
      renounce it for thy sake, and we will escape in company. Listen to me,
      Rebecca,&rdquo; he said, again softening his tone; &ldquo;England,&mdash;Europe,&mdash;is
      not the world. There are spheres in which we may act, ample enough even
      for my ambition. We will go to Palestine, where Conrade, Marquis of
      Montserrat, is my friend&mdash;a friend free as myself from the doting
      scruples which fetter our free-born reason&mdash;rather with Saladin will
      we league ourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we contemn.&mdash;I
      will form new paths to greatness,&rdquo; he continued, again traversing the room
      with hasty strides&mdash;&ldquo;Europe shall hear the loud step of him she has
      driven from her sons!&mdash;Not the millions whom her crusaders send to
      slaughter, can do so much to defend Palestine&mdash;not the sabres of the
      thousands and ten thousands of Saracens can hew their way so deep into
      that land for which nations are striving, as the strength and policy of me
      and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old bigot, will adhere to me
      in good and evil. Thou shalt be a queen, Rebecca&mdash;on Mount Carmel
      shall we pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you, and I will
      exchange my long-desired batoon for a sceptre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dream,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;an empty vision of the night, which, were it a
      waking reality, affects me not. Enough, that the power which thou mightest
      acquire, I will never share; nor hold I so light of country or religious
      faith, as to esteem him who is willing to barter these ties, and cast away
      the bonds of the Order of which he is a sworn member, in order to gratify
      an unruly passion for the daughter of another people.&mdash;Put not a
      price on my deliverance, Sir Knight&mdash;sell not a deed of generosity&mdash;protect
      the oppressed for the sake of charity, and not for a selfish advantage&mdash;Go
      to the throne of England; Richard will listen to my appeal from these
      cruel men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, Rebecca!&rdquo; said the Templar, fiercely. &ldquo;If I renounce my Order, for
      thee alone will I renounce it&mdash;Ambition shall remain mine, if thou
      refuse my love; I will not be fooled on all hands.&mdash;Stoop my crest to
      Richard?&mdash;ask a boon of that heart of pride?&mdash;Never, Rebecca,
      will I place the Order of the Temple at his feet in my person. I may
      forsake the Order, I never will degrade or betray it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now God be gracious to me,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;for the succour of man is
      well-nigh hopeless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;for, proud as thou art, thou hast in me
      found thy match. If I enter the lists with my spear in rest, think not any
      human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength; and think
      then upon thine own fate&mdash;to die the dreadful death of the worst of
      criminals&mdash;to be consumed upon a blazing pile&mdash;dispersed to the
      elements of which our strange forms are so mystically composed&mdash;not a
      relic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived and
      moved!&mdash;Rebecca, it is not in woman to sustain this prospect&mdash;thou
      wilt yield to my suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bois-Guilbert,&rdquo; answered the Jewess, &ldquo;thou knowest not the heart of
      woman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best
      feelings. I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy fiercest battles
      hast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has been shown by
      woman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. I am myself a
      woman, tenderly nurtured, naturally fearful of danger, and impatient of
      pain&mdash;yet, when we enter those fatal lists, thou to fight and I to
      suffer, I feel the strong assurance within me, that my courage shall mount
      higher than thine. Farewell&mdash;I waste no more words on thee; the time
      that remains on earth to the daughter of Jacob must be otherwise spent&mdash;she
      must seek the Comforter, who may hide his face from his people, but who
      ever opens his ear to the cry of those who seek him in sincerity and in
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We part then thus?&rdquo; said the Templar, after a short pause; &ldquo;would to
      Heaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble in birth and
      Christian in faith!&mdash;Nay, by Heaven! when I gaze on thee, and think
      when and how we are next to meet, I could even wish myself one of thine
      own degraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels, instead
      of spear and shield; my head bent down before each petty noble, and my
      look only terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor&mdash;this could I
      wish, Rebecca, to be near to thee in life, and to escape the fearful share
      I must have in thy death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast spoken the Jew,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;as the persecution of such as
      thou art has made him. Heaven in ire has driven him from his country, but
      industry has opened to him the only road to power and to influence, which
      oppression has left unbarred. Read the ancient history of the people of
      God, and tell me if those, by whom Jehovah wrought such marvels among the
      nations, were then a people of misers and of usurers!&mdash;And know,
      proud knight, we number names amongst us to which your boasted northern
      nobility is as the gourd compared with the cedar&mdash;names that ascend
      far back to those high times when the Divine Presence shook the mercy-seat
      between the cherubim, and which derive their splendour from no earthly
      prince, but from the awful Voice, which bade their fathers be nearest of
      the congregation to the Vision&mdash;Such were the princes of the House of
      Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rebecca's colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race, but
      faded as she added, with at sigh, &ldquo;Such WERE the princes of Judah, now
      such no more!&mdash;They are trampled down like the shorn grass, and mixed
      with the mire of the ways. Yet are there those among them who shame not
      such high descent, and of such shall be the daughter of Isaac the son of
      Adonikam! Farewell!&mdash;I envy not thy blood-won honours&mdash;I envy
      not thy barbarous descent from northern heathens&mdash;I envy thee not thy
      faith, which is ever in thy mouth, but never in thy heart nor in thy
      practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a spell on me, by Heaven!&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert. &ldquo;I almost think
      yon besotted skeleton spoke truth, and that the reluctance with which I
      part from thee hath something in it more than is natural.&mdash;Fair
      creature!&rdquo; he said, approaching near her, but with great respect,&mdash;&ldquo;so
      young, so beautiful, so fearless of death! and yet doomed to die, and with
      infamy and agony. Who would not weep for thee?&mdash;The tear, that has
      been a stranger to these eyelids for twenty years, moistens them as I gaze
      on thee. But it must be&mdash;nothing may now save thy life. Thou and I
      are but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality, that hurries
      us along, like goodly vessels driving before the storm, which are dashed
      against each other, and so perish. Forgive me, then, and let us part, at
      least, as friends part. I have assailed thy resolution in vain, and mine
      own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;do men throw on fate the issue of their own wild
      passions. But I do forgive thee, Bois-Guilbert, though the author of my
      early death. There are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind;
      but it is the garden of the sluggard, and the weeds have rushed up, and
      conspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;I am, Rebecca, as thou hast spoken me, untaught,
      untamed&mdash;and proud, that, amidst a shoal of empty fools and crafty
      bigots, I have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me above
      them. I have been a child of battle from my youth upward, high in my
      views, steady and inflexible in pursuing them. Such must I remain&mdash;proud,
      inflexible, and unchanging; and of this the world shall have proof.&mdash;But
      thou forgivest me, Rebecca?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, then,&rdquo; said the Templar, and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Preceptor Albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the return
      of Bois-Guilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast tarried long,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have been as if stretched on red-hot
      iron with very impatience. What if the Grand Master, or his spy Conrade,
      had come hither? I had paid dear for my complaisance.&mdash;But what ails
      thee, brother?&mdash;Thy step totters, thy brow is as black as night. Art
      thou well, Bois-Guilbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered the Templar, &ldquo;as well as the wretch who is doomed to die
      within an hour.&mdash;Nay, by the rood, not half so well&mdash;for there
      be those in such state, who can lay down life like a cast-off garment. By
      Heaven, Malvoisin, yonder girl hath well-nigh unmanned me. I am half
      resolved to go to the Grand Master, abjure the Order to his very teeth,
      and refuse to act the brutality which his tyranny has imposed on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art mad,&rdquo; answered Malvoisin; &ldquo;thou mayst thus indeed utterly ruin
      thyself, but canst not even find a chance thereby to save the life of this
      Jewess, which seems so precious in thine eyes. Beaumanoir will name
      another of the Order to defend his judgment in thy place, and the accused
      will as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty imposed on thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis false&mdash;I will myself take arms in her behalf,&rdquo; answered the
      Templar, haughtily; &ldquo;and, should I do so, I think, Malvoisin, that thou
      knowest not one of the Order, who will keep his saddle before the point of
      my lance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but thou forgettest,&rdquo; said the wily adviser, &ldquo;thou wilt have neither
      leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project. Go to Lucas
      Beaumanoir, and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience, and see how
      long the despotic old man will leave thee in personal freedom. The words
      shall scarce have left thy lips, ere thou wilt either be an hundred feet
      under ground, in the dungeon of the Preceptory, to abide trial as a
      recreant knight; or, if his opinion holds concerning thy possession, thou
      wilt be enjoying straw, darkness, and chains, in some distant convent
      cell, stunned with exorcisms, and drenched with holy water, to expel the
      foul fiend which hath obtained dominion over thee. Thou must to the lists,
      Brian, or thou art a lost and dishonoured man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will break forth and fly,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert&mdash;&ldquo;fly to some
      distant land, to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found their way.
      No drop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by
      my sanction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou canst not fly,&rdquo; said the Preceptor; &ldquo;thy ravings have excited
      suspicion, and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the Preceptory. Go and
      make the essay&mdash;present thyself before the gate, and command the
      bridge to be lowered, and mark what answer thou shalt receive.&mdash;Thou
      are surprised and offended; but is it not the better for thee? Wert thou
      to fly, what would ensue but the reversal of thy arms, the dishonour of
      thine ancestry, the degradation of thy rank?&mdash;Think on it. Where
      shall thine old companions in arms hide their heads when Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, the best lance of the Templars, is proclaimed recreant,
      amid the hisses of the assembled people? What grief will be at the Court
      of France! With what joy will the haughty Richard hear the news, that the
      knight that set him hard in Palestine, and well-nigh darkened his renown,
      has lost fame and honour for a Jewish girl, whom he could not even save by
      so costly a sacrifice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malvoisin,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;I thank thee&mdash;thou hast touched the
      string at which my heart most readily thrills!&mdash;Come of it what may,
      recreant shall never be added to the name of Bois-Guilbert. Would to God,
      Richard, or any of his vaunting minions of England, would appear in these
      lists! But they will be empty&mdash;no one will risk to break a lance for
      the innocent, the forlorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better for thee, if it prove so,&rdquo; said the Preceptor; &ldquo;if no champion
      appears, it is not by thy means that this unlucky damsel shall die, but by
      the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the blame, and who will
      count that blame for praise and commendation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert; &ldquo;if no champion appears, I am but a part of
      the pageant, sitting indeed on horseback in the lists, but having no part
      in what is to follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said Malvoisin; &ldquo;no more than the armed image of Saint
      George when it makes part of a procession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will resume my resolution,&rdquo; replied the haughty Templar. &ldquo;She has
      despised me&mdash;repulsed me&mdash;reviled me&mdash;And wherefore should
      I offer up for her whatever of estimation I have in the opinion of others?
      Malvoisin, I will appear in the lists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the Preceptor
      followed, to watch and confirm him in his resolution; for in
      Bois-Guilbert's fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much
      advantage from his being one day at the head of the Order, not to mention
      the preferment of which Mont-Fitchet had given him hopes, on condition he
      would forward the condemnation of the unfortunate Rebecca. Yet although,
      in combating his friend's better feelings, he possessed all the advantage
      which a wily, composed, selfish disposition has over a man agitated by
      strong and contending passions, it required all Malvoisin's art to keep
      Bois-Guilbert steady to the purpose he had prevailed on him to adopt. He
      was obliged to watch him closely to prevent his resuming his purpose of
      flight, to intercept his communication with the Grand Master, lest he
      should come to an open rupture with his Superior, and to renew, from time
      to time, the various arguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in
      appearing as champion on this occasion, Bois-Guilbert, without either
      accelerating or ensuring the fate of Rebecca, would follow the only course
      by which he could save himself from degradation and disgrace.

      CHAPTER XL
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Shadows avaunt!&mdash;Richard's himself again.
     Richard III
</pre>
    <p>
      When the Black Knight&mdash;for it becomes necessary to resume the train
      of his adventures&mdash;left the Trysting-tree of the generous Outlaw, he
      held his way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent
      and revenue, called the Priory of Saint Botolph, to which the wounded
      Ivanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance of
      the faithful Gurth, and the magnanimous Wamba. It is unnecessary at
      present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt Wilfred and his
      deliverer; suffice it to say, that after long and grave communication,
      messengers were dispatched by the Prior in several directions, and that on
      the succeeding morning the Black Knight was about to set forth on his
      journey, accompanied by the jester Wamba, who attended as his guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will meet,&rdquo; he said to Ivanhoe, &ldquo;at Coningsburgh, the castle of the
      deceased Athelstane, since there thy father Cedric holds the funeral feast
      for his noble relation. I would see your Saxon kindred together, Sir
      Wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore. Thou also
      wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he took an affectionate farewell of Ivanhoe, who expressed an
      anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. But the Black Knight would
      not listen to the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the
      next. I will have no guide with me but honest Wamba, who can play priest
      or fool as I shall be most in the humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;will attend you with all my heart. I would fain see
      the feasting at the funeral of Athelstane; for, if it be not full and
      frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and cupbearer;
      and that were a sight worth seeing. Always, Sir Knight, I will trust your
      valour with making my excuse to my master Cedric, in case mine own wit
      should fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how should my poor valour succeed, Sir Jester, when thy light wit
      halts?&mdash;resolve me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wit, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied the Jester, &ldquo;may do much. He is a quick,
      apprehensive knave, who sees his neighbours blind side, and knows how to
      keep the lee-gage when his passions are blowing high. But valour is a
      sturdy fellow, that makes all split. He rows against both wind and tide,
      and makes way notwithstanding; and, therefore, good Sir Knight, while I
      take advantage of the fair weather in our noble master's temper, I will
      expect you to bestir yourself when it grows rough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight of the Fetterlock, since it is your pleasure so to be
      distinguished,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;I fear me you have chosen a talkative and a
      troublesome fool to be your guide. But he knows every path and alley in
      the woods as well as e'er a hunter who frequents them; and the poor knave,
      as thou hast partly seen, is as faithful as steel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Knight, &ldquo;an he have the gift of showing my road, I shall
      not grumble with him that he desires to make it pleasant.&mdash;Fare thee
      well, kind Wilfred&mdash;I charge thee not to attempt to travel till
      to-morrow at earliest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he extended his hand to Ivanhoe, who pressed it to his lips,
      took leave of the Prior, mounted his horse, and departed, with Wamba for
      his companion. Ivanhoe followed them with his eyes, until they were lost
      in the shades of the surrounding forest, and then returned into the
      convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But shortly after matin-song, he requested to see the Prior. The old man
      came in haste, and enquired anxiously after the state of his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than my fondest hope could have anticipated;
      either my wound has been slighter than the effusion of blood led me to
      suppose, or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure upon it. I feel
      already as if I could bear my corslet; and so much the better, for
      thoughts pass in my mind which render me unwilling to remain here longer
      in inactivity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, the saints forbid,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;that the son of the Saxon
      Cedric should leave our convent ere his wounds were healed! It were shame
      to our profession were we to suffer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor would I desire to leave your hospitable roof, venerable father,&rdquo; said
      Ivanhoe, &ldquo;did I not feel myself able to endure the journey, and compelled
      to undertake it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can have urged you to so sudden a departure?&rdquo; said the Prior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never, holy father,&rdquo; answered the Knight, &ldquo;felt an apprehension
      of approaching evil, for which you in vain attempted to assign a cause?&mdash;Have
      you never found your mind darkened, like the sunny landscape, by the
      sudden cloud, which augurs a coming tempest?&mdash;And thinkest thou not
      that such impulses are deserving of attention, as being the hints of our
      guardian spirits, that danger is impending?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not deny,&rdquo; said the Prior, crossing himself, &ldquo;that such things have
      been, and have been of Heaven; but then such communications have had a
      visibly useful scope and tendency. But thou, wounded as thou art, what
      avails it thou shouldst follow the steps of him whom thou couldst not aid,
      were he to be assaulted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prior,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;thou dost mistake&mdash;I am stout enough to
      exchange buffets with any who will challenge me to such a traffic&mdash;But
      were it otherwise, may I not aid him were he in danger, by other means
      than by force of arms? It is but too well known that the Saxons love not
      the Norman race, and who knows what may be the issue, if he break in upon
      them when their hearts are irritated by the death of Athelstane, and their
      heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge themselves? I hold
      his entrance among them at such a moment most perilous, and I am resolved
      to share or avert the danger; which, that I may the better do, I would
      crave of thee the use of some palfrey whose pace may be softer than that
      of my 'destrier'.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-56" name="linknoteref-56"       id="linknoteref-56"><small>56</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said the worthy churchman; &ldquo;you shall have mine own ambling
      jennet, and I would it ambled as easy for your sake as that of the Abbot
      of Saint Albans. Yet this will I say for Malkin, for so I call her, that
      unless you were to borrow a ride on the juggler's steed that paces a
      hornpipe amongst the eggs, you could not go a journey on a creature so
      gentle and smooth-paced. I have composed many a homily on her back, to the
      edification of my brethren of the convent, and many poor Christian souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, reverend father,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;let Malkin be got ready
      instantly, and bid Gurth attend me with mine arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but fair sir,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;I pray you to remember that Malkin
      hath as little skill in arms as her master, and that I warrant not her
      enduring the sight or weight of your full panoply. O, Malkin, I promise
      you, is a beast of judgment, and will contend against any undue weight&mdash;I
      did but borrow the 'Fructus Temporum' from the priest of Saint Bees, and I
      promise you she would not stir from the gate until I had exchanged the
      huge volume for my little breviary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, holy father,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;I will not distress her with too
      much weight; and if she calls a combat with me, it is odds but she has the
      worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reply was made while Gurth was buckling on the Knight's heels a pair
      of large gilded spurs, capable of convincing any restive horse that his
      best safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep and sharp rowels with which Ivanhoe's heels were now armed, began
      to make the worthy Prior repent of his courtesy, and ejaculate,&mdash;&ldquo;Nay,
      but fair sir, now I bethink me, my Malkin abideth not the spur&mdash;Better
      it were that you tarry for the mare of our manciple down at the Grange,
      which may be had in little more than an hour, and cannot but be tractable,
      in respect that she draweth much of our winter fire-wood, and eateth no
      corn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, reverend father, but will abide by your first offer, as I
      see Malkin is already led forth to the gate. Gurth shall carry mine
      armour; and for the rest, rely on it, that as I will not overload Malkin's
      back, she shall not overcome my patience. And now, farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his wound
      promised, and threw himself upon the jennet, eager to escape the
      importunity of the Prior, who stuck as closely to his side as his age and
      fatness would permit, now singing the praises of Malkin, now recommending
      caution to the Knight in managing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,&rdquo; said
      the old man, laughing at his own jest, &ldquo;being barely in her fifteenth
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfrey's
      paces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the Prior's grave advices and
      facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and commanded his squire
      (for such Gurth now called himself) to keep close by his side, he followed
      the track of the Black Knight into the forest, while the Prior stood at
      the gate of the convent looking after him, and ejaculating,&mdash;&ldquo;Saint
      Mary! how prompt and fiery be these men of war! I would I had not trusted
      Malkin to his keeping, for, crippled as I am with the cold rheum, I am
      undone if aught but good befalls her. And yet,&rdquo; said he, recollecting
      himself, &ldquo;as I would not spare my own old and disabled limbs in the good
      cause of Old England, so Malkin must e'en run her hazard on the same
      venture; and it may be they will think our poor house worthy of some
      munificent guerdon&mdash;or, it may be, they will send the old Prior a
      pacing nag. And if they do none of these, as great men will forget little
      men's service, truly I shall hold me well repaid in having done that which
      is right. And it is now well-nigh the fitting time to summon the brethren
      to breakfast in the refectory&mdash;Ah! I doubt they obey that call more
      cheerily than the bells for primes and matins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Prior of Saint Botolph's hobbled back again into the refectory, to
      preside over the stockfish and ale, which was just serving out for the
      friars' breakfast. Busy and important, he sat him down at the table, and
      many a dark word he threw out, of benefits to be expected to the convent,
      and high deeds of service done by himself, which, at another season, would
      have attracted observation. But as the stockfish was highly salted, and
      the ale reasonably powerful, the jaws of the brethren were too anxiously
      employed to admit of their making much use of their ears; nor do we read
      of any of the fraternity, who was tempted to speculate upon the mysterious
      hints of their Superior, except Father Diggory, who was severely afflicted
      by the toothache, so that he could only eat on one side of his jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the Black Champion and his guide were pacing at their
      leisure through the recesses of the forest; the good Knight whiles humming
      to himself the lay of some enamoured troubadour, sometimes encouraging by
      questions the prating disposition of his attendant, so that their dialogue
      formed a whimsical mixture of song and jest, of which we would fain give
      our readers some idea. You are then to imagine this Knight, such as we
      have already described him, strong of person, tall, broad-shouldered, and
      large of bone, mounted on his mighty black charger, which seemed made on
      purpose to bear his weight, so easily he paced forward under it, having
      the visor of his helmet raised, in order to admit freedom of breath, yet
      keeping the beaver, or under part, closed, so that his features could be
      but imperfectly distinguished. But his ruddy embrowned cheek-bones could
      be plainly seen, and the large and bright blue eyes, that flashed from
      under the dark shade of the raised visor; and the whole gesture and look
      of the champion expressed careless gaiety and fearless confidence&mdash;a
      mind which was unapt to apprehend danger, and prompt to defy it when most
      imminent&mdash;yet with whom danger was a familiar thought, as with one
      whose trade was war and adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jester wore his usual fantastic habit, but late accidents had led him
      to adopt a good cutting falchion, instead of his wooden sword, with a
      targe to match it; of both which weapons he had, notwithstanding his
      profession, shown himself a skilful master during the storming of
      Torquilstone. Indeed, the infirmity of Wamba's brain consisted chiefly in
      a kind of impatient irritability, which suffered him not long to remain
      quiet in any posture, or adhere to any certain train of ideas, although he
      was for a few minutes alert enough in performing any immediate task, or in
      apprehending any immediate topic. On horseback, therefore, he was
      perpetually swinging himself backwards and forwards, now on the horse's
      ears, then anon on the very rump of the animal,&mdash;now hanging both his
      legs on one side, and now sitting with his face to the tail, moping,
      mowing, and making a thousand apish gestures, until his palfrey took his
      freaks so much to heart, as fairly to lay him at his length on the green
      grass&mdash;an incident which greatly amused the Knight, but compelled his
      companion to ride more steadily thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the point of their journey at which we take them up, this joyous pair
      were engaged in singing a virelai, as it was called, in which the clown
      bore a mellow burden, to the better instructed Knight of the Fetterlock.
      And thus run the ditty:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Anna-Marie, love, up is the sun,
     Anna-Marie, love, morn is begun,
     Mists are dispersing, love, birds singing free,
     Up in the morning, love, Anna-Marie.
     Anna-Marie, love, up in the morn,
     The hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn,
     The echo rings merry from rock and from tree,
     'Tis time to arouse thee, love, Anna-Marie.
</pre>
    <p>
      Wamba.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O Tybalt, love, Tybalt, awake me not yet,
     Around my soft pillow while softer dreams flit,
     For what are the joys that in waking we prove,
     Compared with these visions, O, Tybalt, my love?
     Let the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill,
     Let the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill,
     Softer sounds, softer pleasures, in slumber I prove,&mdash;
     But think not I dreamt of thee, Tybalt, my love.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dainty song,&rdquo; said Wamba, when they had finished their carol, &ldquo;and I
      swear by my bauble, a pretty moral!&mdash;I used to sing it with Gurth,
      once my playfellow, and now, by the grace of God and his master, no less
      than a freemen; and we once came by the cudgel for being so entranced by
      the melody, that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise, singing the ditty
      betwixt sleeping and waking&mdash;my bones ache at thinking of the tune
      ever since. Nevertheless, I have played the part of Anna-Marie, to please
      you, fair sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to which
      the Knight, catching up the tune, replied in the like manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knight and Wamba.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     There came three merry men from south, west, and north,
     Ever more sing the roundelay;
     To win the Widow of Wycombe forth,
     And where was the widow might say them nay?

     The first was a knight, and from Tynedale he came,
     Ever more sing the roundelay;
     And his fathers, God save us, were men of great fame,
     And where was the widow might say him nay?

     Of his father the laird, of his uncle the squire,
     He boasted in rhyme and in roundelay;
     She bade him go bask by his sea-coal fire,
     For she was the widow would say him nay.
</pre>
    <p>
      Wamba.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The next that came forth, swore by blood and by nails,
     Merrily sing the roundelay;
     Hur's a gentleman, God wot, and hur's lineage was of Wales,
     And where was the widow might say him nay?

     Sir David ap Morgan ap Griffith ap Hugh
     Ap Tudor ap Rhice, quoth his roundelay
     She said that one widow for so many was too few,
     And she bade the Welshman wend his way.

     But then next came a yeoman, a yeoman of Kent,
     Jollily singing his roundelay;
     He spoke to the widow of living and rent,
     And where was the widow could say him nay?
</pre>
    <p>
      Both.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     So the knight and the squire were both left in the mire,
     There for to sing their roundelay;
     For a yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent,
     There never was a widow could say him nay.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, Wamba,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;that our host of the Trysting-tree, or
      the jolly Friar, his chaplain, heard this thy ditty in praise of our bluff
      yeoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would not I,&rdquo; said Wamba&mdash;&ldquo;but for the horn that hangs at your
      baldric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the Knight,&mdash;&ldquo;this is a pledge of Locksley's goodwill,
      though I am not like to need it. Three mots on this bugle will, I am
      assured, bring round, at our need, a jolly band of yonder honest yeomen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would say, Heaven forefend,&rdquo; said the Jester, &ldquo;were it not that that
      fair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what meanest thou?&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;thinkest thou that but for
      this pledge of fellowship they would assault us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, for me I say nothing,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;for green trees have ears as
      well as stone walls. But canst thou construe me this, Sir Knight&mdash;When
      is thy wine-pitcher and thy purse better empty than full?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, never, I think,&rdquo; replied the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand, for so simple an
      answer! Thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it to a Saxon, and
      leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold our friends for robbers, then?&rdquo; said the Knight of the
      Fetterlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear me not say so, fair sir,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;it may relieve a man's
      steed to take of his mail when he hath a long journey to make; and,
      certes, it may do good to the rider's soul to ease him of that which is
      the root of evil; therefore will I give no hard names to those who do such
      services. Only I would wish my mail at home, and my purse in my chamber,
      when I meet with these good fellows, because it might save them some
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WE are bound to pray for them, my friend, notwithstanding the fair
      character thou dost afford them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray for them with all my heart,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;but in the town, not in
      the greenwood, like the Abbot of Saint Bees, whom they caused to say mass
      with an old hollow oak-tree for his stall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say as thou list, Wamba,&rdquo; replied the Knight, &ldquo;these yeomen did thy
      master Cedric yeomanly service at Torquilstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, truly,&rdquo; answered Wamba; &ldquo;but that was in the fashion of their trade
      with Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their trade, Wamba! how mean you by that?&rdquo; replied his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, thus,&rdquo; said the Jester. &ldquo;They make up a balanced account with
      Heaven, as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering, as fair as Isaac
      the Jew keeps with his debtors, and, like him, give out a very little, and
      take large credit for doing so; reckoning, doubtless, on their own behalf
      the seven-fold usury which the blessed text hath promised to charitable
      loans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me an example of your meaning, Wamba,&mdash;I know nothing of
      ciphers or rates of usage,&rdquo; answered the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;an your valour be so dull, you will please to learn
      that those honest fellows balance a good deed with one not quite so
      laudable; as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants
      taken from a fat abbot, or a wench kissed in the greenwood with the relief
      of a poor widow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of these was the good deed, which was the felony?&rdquo; interrupted the
      Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good gibe! a good gibe!&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;keeping witty company sharpeneth
      the apprehension. You said nothing so well, Sir Knight, I will be sworn,
      when you held drunken vespers with the bluff Hermit.&mdash;But to go on.
      The merry-men of the forest set off the building of a cottage with the
      burning of a castle,&mdash;the thatching of a choir against the robbing of
      a church,&mdash;the setting free a poor prisoner against the murder of a
      proud sheriff; or, to come nearer to our point, the deliverance of a Saxon
      franklin against the burning alive of a Norman baron. Gentle thieves they
      are, in short, and courteous robbers; but it is ever the luckiest to meet
      with them when they are at the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, Wamba?&rdquo; said the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then they have some compunction, and are for making up matters with
      Heaven. But when they have struck an even balance, Heaven help them with
      whom they next open the account! The travellers who first met them after
      their good service at Torquilstone would have a woeful flaying.&mdash;And
      yet,&rdquo; said Wamba, coming close up to the Knight's side, &ldquo;there be
      companions who are far more dangerous for travellers to meet than yonder
      outlaws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who may they be, for you have neither bears nor wolves, I trow?&rdquo; said
      the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry, sir, but we have Malvoisin's men-at-arms,&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;and let me
      tell you, that, in time of civil war, a halfscore of these is worth a band
      of wolves at any time. They are now expecting their harvest, and are
      reinforced with the soldiers that escaped from Torquilstone. So that,
      should we meet with a band of them, we are like to pay for our feats of
      arms.&mdash;Now, I pray you, Sir Knight, what would you do if we met two
      of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pin the villains to the earth with my lance, Wamba, if they offered us
      any impediment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if there were four of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They should drink of the same cup,&rdquo; answered the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if six,&rdquo; continued Wamba, &ldquo;and we as we now are, barely two&mdash;would
      you not remember Locksley's horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! sound for aid,&rdquo; exclaimed the Knight, &ldquo;against a score of such
      'rascaille' as these, whom one good knight could drive before him, as the
      wind drives the withered leaves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;I will pray you for a close sight of that same
      horn that hath so powerful a breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his
      fellow-traveller, who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tra-lira-la,&rdquo; said he, whistling the notes; &ldquo;nay, I know my gamut as well
      as another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How mean you, knave?&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;restore me the bugle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content you, Sir Knight, it is in safe keeping. When Valour and Folly
      travel, Folly should bear the horn, because she can blow the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay but, rogue,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;this exceedeth thy license&mdash;Beware
      ye tamper not with my patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Urge me not with violence, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the Jester, keeping at a
      distance from the impatient champion, &ldquo;or Folly will show a clean pair of
      heels, and leave Valour to find out his way through the wood as best he
      may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, thou hast hit me there,&rdquo; said the Knight; &ldquo;and, sooth to say, I have
      little time to jangle with thee. Keep the horn an thou wilt, but let us
      proceed on our journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not harm me, then?&rdquo; said Wamba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee no, thou knave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but pledge me your knightly word for it,&rdquo; continued Wamba, as he
      approached with great caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My knightly word I pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, Valour and Folly are once more boon companions,&rdquo; said the
      Jester, coming up frankly to the Knight's side; &ldquo;but, in truth, I love not
      such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly Friar, when his holiness
      rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins. And now that Folly wears
      the horn, let Valour rouse himself, and shake his mane; for, if I mistake
      not, there are company in yonder brake that are on the look-out for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes thee judge so?&rdquo; said the Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have twice or thrice noticed the glance of a motion from
      amongst the green leaves. Had they been honest men, they had kept the
      path. But yonder thicket is a choice chapel for the Clerks of Saint
      Nicholas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the Knight, closing his visor, &ldquo;I think thou be'st in
      the right on't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in good time did he close it, for three arrows, flew at the same
      instant from the suspected spot against his head and breast, one of which
      would have penetrated to the brain, had it not been turned aside by the
      steel visor. The other two were averted by the gorget, and by the shield
      which hung around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, trusty armourers,&rdquo; said the Knight.&mdash;&ldquo;Wamba, let us close
      with them,&rdquo;&mdash;and he rode straight to the thicket. He was met by six
      or seven men-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at full
      career. Three of the weapons struck against him, and splintered with as
      little effect as if they had been driven against a tower of steel. The
      Black Knight's eyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his
      visor. He raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible
      dignity, and exclaimed, &ldquo;What means this, my masters!&rdquo;&mdash;The men made
      no other reply than by drawing their swords and attacking him on every
      side, crying, &ldquo;Die, tyrant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Saint Edward! Ha! Saint George!&rdquo; said the Black Knight, striking down
      a man at every invocation; &ldquo;have we traitors here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His opponents, desperate as they were, bore back from an arm which carried
      death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror of his single strength
      was about to gain the battle against such odds, when a knight, in blue
      armour, who had hitherto kept himself behind the other assailants, spurred
      forward with his lance, and taking aim, not at the rider but at the steed,
      wounded the noble animal mortally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a felon stroke!&rdquo; exclaimed the Black Knight, as the steed fell
      to the earth, bearing his rider along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this moment, Wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so
      speedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. The sudden sound made the
      murderers bear back once more, and Wamba, though so imperfectly weaponed,
      did not hesitate to rush in and assist the Black Knight to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on ye, false cowards!&rdquo; exclaimed he in the blue harness, who seemed
      to lead the assailants, &ldquo;do ye fly from the empty blast of a horn blown by
      a Jester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Animated by his words, they attacked the Black Knight anew, whose best
      refuge was now to place his back against an oak, and defend himself with
      his sword. The felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching the
      moment when his formidable antagonist was most closely pressed, galloped
      against him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the tree, when his
      purpose was again intercepted by Wamba. The Jester, making up by agility
      the want of strength, and little noticed by the men-at-arms, who were
      busied in their more important object, hovered on the skirts of the fight,
      and effectually checked the fatal career of the Blue Knight, by
      hamstringing his horse with a stroke of his sword. Horse and man went to
      the ground; yet the situation of the Knight of the Fetterlock continued
      very precarious, as he was pressed close by several men completely armed,
      and began to be fatigued by the violent exertions necessary to defend
      himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when a grey-goose
      shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most formidable of his
      assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the glade, headed by
      Locksley and the jovial Friar, who, taking ready and effectual part in the
      fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom lay on the spot dead or
      mortally wounded. The Black Knight thanked his deliverers with a dignity
      they had not observed in his former bearing, which hitherto had seemed
      rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a person of exalted rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It concerns me much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;even before I express my full gratitude
      to my ready friends, to discover, if I may, who have been my unprovoked
      enemies.&mdash;Open the visor of that Blue Knight, Wamba, who seems the
      chief of these villains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins, who, bruised
      by his fall, and entangled under the wounded steed, lay incapable either
      of flight or resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, valiant sir,&rdquo; said Wamba, &ldquo;I must be your armourer as well as your
      equerry&mdash;I have dismounted you, and now I will unhelm you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the Blue
      Knight, which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed to the Knight
      of the Fetterlock grizzled locks, and a countenance he did not expect to
      have seen under such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waldemar Fitzurse!&rdquo; he said in astonishment; &ldquo;what could urge one of thy
      rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said the captive Knight, looking up to him, &ldquo;thou knowest
      little of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can
      lead every child of Adam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenge?&rdquo; answered the Black Knight; &ldquo;I never wronged thee&mdash;On me
      thou hast nought to revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter, Richard, whose alliance thou didst scorn&mdash;was that no
      injury to a Norman, whose blood is noble as thine own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy daughter?&rdquo; replied the Black Knight; &ldquo;a proper cause of enmity, and
      followed up to a bloody issue!&mdash;Stand back, my masters, I would speak
      to him alone.&mdash;And now, Waldemar Fitzurse, say me the truth&mdash;confess
      who set thee on this traitorous deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy father's son,&rdquo; answered Waldemar, &ldquo;who, in so doing, did but avenge
      on thee thy disobedience to thy father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard's eyes sparkled with indignation, but his better nature overcame
      it. He pressed his hand against his brow, and remained an instant gazing
      on the face of the humbled baron, in whose features pride was contending
      with shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou dost not ask thy life, Waldemar,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He that is in the lion's clutch,&rdquo; answered Fitzurse, &ldquo;knows it were
      needless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it, then, unasked,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;the lion preys not on prostrate
      carcasses.&mdash;Take thy life, but with this condition, that in three
      days thou shalt leave England, and go to hide thine infamy in thy Norman
      castle, and that thou wilt never mention the name of John of Anjou as
      connected with thy felony. If thou art found on English ground after the
      space I have allotted thee, thou diest&mdash;or if thou breathest aught
      that can attaint the honour of my house, by Saint George! not the altar
      itself shall be a sanctuary. I will hang thee out to feed the ravens, from
      the very pinnacle of thine own castle.&mdash;Let this knight have a steed,
      Locksley, for I see your yeomen have caught those which were running
      loose, and let him depart unharmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that I judge I listen to a voice whose behests must not be disputed,&rdquo;
       answered the yeoman, &ldquo;I would send a shaft after the skulking villain that
      should spare him the labour of a long journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou bearest an English heart, Locksley,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;and
      well dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behest&mdash;I am
      Richard of England!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high rank,
      and no less distinguished character of Coeur-de-Lion, the yeomen at once
      kneeled down before him, and at the same time tendered their allegiance,
      and implored pardon for their offences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, my friends,&rdquo; said Richard, in a gracious tone, looking on them with
      a countenance in which his habitual good-humour had already conquered the
      blaze of hasty resentment, and whose features retained no mark of the late
      desperate conflict, excepting the flush arising from exertion,&mdash;&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;my friends!&mdash;Your misdemeanours, whether in forest or
      field, have been atoned by the loyal services you rendered my distressed
      subjects before the walls of Torquilstone, and the rescue you have this
      day afforded to your sovereign. Arise, my liegemen, and be good subjects
      in future.&mdash;And thou, brave Locksley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me no longer Locksley, my Liege, but know me under the name, which,
      I fear, fame hath blown too widely not to have reached even your royal
      ears&mdash;I am Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-561"      name="linknoteref-561" id="linknoteref-561"><small>561</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King of Outlaws, and Prince of good fellows!&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;who hath
      not heard a name that has been borne as far as Palestine? But be assured,
      brave Outlaw, that no deed done in our absence, and in the turbulent times
      to which it hath given rise, shall be remembered to thy disadvantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True says the proverb,&rdquo; said Wamba, interposing his word, but with some
      abatement of his usual petulance,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'When the cat is away, The mice will play.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Wamba, art thou there?&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;I have been so long of
      hearing thy voice, I thought thou hadst taken flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take flight!&rdquo; said Wamba; &ldquo;when do you ever find Folly separated from
      Valour? There lies the trophy of my sword, that good grey gelding, whom I
      heartily wish upon his legs again, conditioning his master lay there
      houghed in his place. It is true, I gave a little ground at first, for a
      motley jacket does not brook lance-heads, as a steel doublet will. But if
      I fought not at sword's point, you will grant me that I sounded the
      onset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to good purpose, honest Wamba,&rdquo; replied the King. &ldquo;Thy good service
      shall not be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Confiteor! Confiteor!'&rdquo;&mdash;exclaimed, in a submissive tone, a voice
      near the King's side&mdash;&ldquo;my Latin will carry me no farther&mdash;but I
      confess my deadly treason, and pray leave to have absolution before I am
      led to execution!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard looked around, and beheld the jovial Friar on his knees, telling
      his rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idle during the
      skirmish, lay on the grass beside him. His countenance was gathered so as
      he thought might best express the most profound contrition, his eyes being
      turned up, and the corners of his mouth drawn down, as Wamba expressed it,
      like the tassels at the mouth of a purse. Yet this demure affectation of
      extreme penitence was whimsically belied by a ludicrous meaning which
      lurked in his huge features, and seemed to pronounce his fear and
      repentance alike hypocritical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what art thou cast down, mad Priest?&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;art thou afraid
      thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve Our Lady and Saint
      Dunstan?&mdash;Tush, man! fear it not; Richard of England betrays no
      secrets that pass over the flagon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, most gracious sovereign,&rdquo; answered the Hermit, (well known to the
      curious in penny-histories of Robin Hood, by the name of Friar Tuck,) &ldquo;it
      is not the crosier I fear, but the sceptre.&mdash;Alas! that my
      sacrilegious fist should ever have been applied to the ear of the Lord's
      anointed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;sits the wind there?&mdash;In truth I had
      forgotten the buffet, though mine ear sung after it for a whole day. But
      if the cuff was fairly given, I will be judged by the good men around, if
      it was not as well repaid&mdash;or, if thou thinkest I still owe thee
      aught, and will stand forth for another counterbuff&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; replied Friar Tuck, &ldquo;I had mine own returned, and with
      usury&mdash;may your Majesty ever pay your debts as fully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could do so with cuffs,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;my creditors should have
      little reason to complain of an empty exchequer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the Friar, resuming his demure hypocritical countenance,
      &ldquo;I know not what penance I ought to perform for that most sacrilegious
      blow!&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak no more of it, brother,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;after having stood so many
      cuffs from Paynims and misbelievers, I were void of reason to quarrel with
      the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of Copmanhurst. Yet, mine honest
      Friar, I think it would be best both for the church and thyself, that I
      should procure a license to unfrock thee, and retain thee as a yeoman of
      our guard, serving in care of our person, as formerly in attendance upon
      the altar of Saint Dunstan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Liege,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;I humbly crave your pardon; and you would
      readily grant my excuse, did you but know how the sin of laziness has
      beset me. Saint Dunstan&mdash;may he be gracious to us!&mdash;stands quiet
      in his niche, though I should forget my orisons in killing a fat buck&mdash;I
      stay out of my cell sometimes a night, doing I wot not what&mdash;Saint
      Dunstan never complains&mdash;a quiet master he is, and a peaceful, as
      ever was made of wood.&mdash;But to be a yeoman in attendance on my
      sovereign the King&mdash;the honour is great, doubtless&mdash;yet, if I
      were but to step aside to comfort a widow in one corner, or to kill a deer
      in another, it would be, 'where is the dog Priest?' says one. 'Who has
      seen the accursed Tuck?' says another. 'The unfrocked villain destroys
      more venison than half the country besides,' says one keeper; 'And is
      hunting after every shy doe in the country!' quoth a second.&mdash;In
      fine, good my Liege, I pray you to leave me as you found me; or, if in
      aught you desire to extend your benevolence to me, that I may be
      considered as the poor Clerk of Saint Dunstan's cell in Copmanhurst, to
      whom any small donation will be most thankfully acceptable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand thee,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and the Holy Clerk shall have a grant
      of vert and venison in my woods of Warncliffe. Mark, however, I will but
      assign thee three bucks every season; but if that do not prove an apology
      for thy slaying thirty, I am no Christian knight nor true king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace may be well assured,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;that, with the grace of
      Saint Dunstan, I shall find the way of multiplying your most bounteous
      gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nothing doubt it, good brother,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;and as venison is but
      dry food, our cellarer shall have orders to deliver to thee a butt of
      sack, a runlet of Malvoisie, and three hogsheads of ale of the first
      strike, yearly&mdash;If that will not quench thy thirst, thou must come to
      court, and become acquainted with my butler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for Saint Dunstan?&rdquo; said the Friar&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cope, a stole, and an altar-cloth shalt thou also have,&rdquo; continued the
      King, crossing himself&mdash;&ldquo;But we may not turn our game into earnest,
      lest God punish us for thinking more on our follies than on his honour and
      worship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer for my patron,&rdquo; said the Priest, joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer for thyself, Friar,&rdquo; said King Richard, something sternly; but
      immediately stretching out his hand to the Hermit, the latter, somewhat
      abashed, bent his knee, and saluted it. &ldquo;Thou dost less honour to my
      extended palm than to my clenched fist,&rdquo; said the Monarch; &ldquo;thou didst
      only kneel to the one, and to the other didst prostrate thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Friar, afraid perhaps of again giving offence by continuing the
      conversation in too jocose a style&mdash;a false step to be particularly
      guarded against by those who converse with monarchs&mdash;bowed
      profoundly, and fell into the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, two additional personages appeared on the scene.

     All hail to the lordlings of high degree,

    <p>
      The new comers were Wilfred of Ivanhoe, on the Prior of Botolph's palfrey,
      and Gurth, who attended him, on the Knight's own war-horse. The
      astonishment of Ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master
      besprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in the
      little glade in which the battle had taken place. Nor was he less
      surprised to see Richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the
      outlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue
      therefore for a prince. He hesitated whether to address the King as the
      Black Knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards
      him. Richard saw his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not, Wilfred,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to address Richard Plantagenet as himself,
      since thou seest him in the company of true English hearts, although it
      may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm English blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said the gallant Outlaw, stepping forward, &ldquo;my
      assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet, let me say
      somewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not truer
      subjects than those who now stand around him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot doubt it, brave man,&rdquo; said Wilfred, &ldquo;since thou art of the
      number&mdash;But what mean these marks of death and danger? these slain
      men, and the bloody armour of my Prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treason hath been with us, Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;but, thanks to these
      brave men, treason hath met its meed&mdash;But, now I bethink me, thou too
      art a traitor,&rdquo; said Richard, smiling; &ldquo;a most disobedient traitor; for
      were not our orders positive, that thou shouldst repose thyself at Saint
      Botolph's until thy wound was healed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is healed,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;it is not of more consequence than the
      scratch of a bodkin. But why, oh why, noble Prince, will you thus vex the
      hearts of your faithful servants, and expose your life by lonely journeys
      and rash adventures, as if it were of no more value than that of a mere
      knight-errant, who has no interest on earth but what lance and sword may
      procure him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Richard Plantagenet,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;desires no more fame than his
      good lance and sword may acquire him&mdash;and Richard Plantagenet is
      prouder of achieving an adventure, with only his good sword, and his good
      arm to speed, than if he led to battle a host of an hundred thousand armed
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your kingdom, my Liege,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;your kingdom is threatened
      with dissolution and civil war&mdash;your subjects menaced with every
      species of evil, if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers
      which it is your daily pleasure to incur, and from which you have but this
      moment narrowly escaped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! my kingdom and my subjects?&rdquo; answered Richard, impatiently; &ldquo;I
      tell thee, Sir Wilfred, the best of them are most willing to repay my
      follies in kind&mdash;For example, my very faithful servant, Wilfred of
      Ivanhoe, will not obey my positive commands, and yet reads his king a
      homily, because he does not walk exactly by his advice. Which of us has
      most reason to upbraid the other?&mdash;Yet forgive me, my faithful
      Wilfred. The time I have spent, and am yet to spend in concealment, is, as
      I explained to thee at Saint Botolph's, necessary to give my friends and
      faithful nobles time to assemble their forces, that when Richard's return
      is announced, he should be at the head of such a force as enemies shall
      tremble to face, and thus subdue the meditated treason, without even
      unsheathing a sword. Estoteville and Bohun will not be strong enough to
      move forward to York for twenty-four hours. I must have news of Salisbury
      from the south; and of Beauchamp, in Warwickshire; and of Multon and Percy
      in the north. The Chancellor must make sure of London. Too sudden an
      appearance would subject me to dangers, other than my lance and sword,
      though backed by the bow of bold Robin, or the quarter-staff of Friar
      Tuck, and the horn of the sage Wamba, may be able to rescue me from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend with
      the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master upon
      dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it was
      unpardonable in him to have sought out. The young knight sighed,
      therefore, and held his peace; while Richard, rejoiced at having silenced
      his counsellor, though his heart acknowledged the justice of the charge he
      had brought against him, went on in conversation with Robin Hood.&mdash;&ldquo;King
      of Outlaws,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you no refreshment to offer to your brother
      sovereign? for these dead knaves have found me both in exercise and
      appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In troth,&rdquo; replied the Outlaw, &ldquo;for I scorn to lie to your Grace, our
      larder is chiefly supplied with&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, and was somewhat
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With venison, I suppose?&rdquo; said Richard, gaily; &ldquo;better food at need there
      can be none&mdash;and truly, if a king will not remain at home and slay
      his own game, methinks he should not brawl too loud if he finds it killed
      to his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your Grace, then,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;will again honour with your presence
      one of Robin Hood's places of rendezvous, the venison shall not be
      lacking; and a stoup of ale, and it may be a cup of reasonably good wine,
      to relish it withal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Outlaw accordingly led the way, followed by the buxom Monarch, more
      happy, probably, in this chance meeting with Robin Hood and his foresters,
      than he would have been in again assuming his royal state, and presiding
      over a splendid circle of peers and nobles. Novelty in society and
      adventure were the zest of life to Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and it had its
      highest relish when enhanced by dangers encountered and surmounted. In the
      lion-hearted King, the brilliant, but useless character, of a knight of
      romance, was in a great measure realized and revived; and the personal
      glory which he acquired by his own deeds of arms, was far more dear to his
      excited imagination, than that which a course of policy and wisdom would
      have spread around his government. Accordingly, his reign was like the
      course of a brilliant and rapid meteor, which shoots along the face of
      Heaven, shedding around an unnecessary and portentous light, which is
      instantly swallowed up by universal darkness; his feats of chivalry
      furnishing themes for bards and minstrels, but affording none of those
      solid benefits to his country on which history loves to pause, and hold up
      as an example to posterity. But in his present company Richard showed to
      the greatest imaginable advantage. He was gay, good-humoured, and fond of
      manhood in every rank of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath a huge oak-tree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the
      King of England, surrounded by men outlaws to his government, but who now
      formed his court and his guard. As the flagon went round, the rough
      foresters soon lost their awe for the presence of Majesty. The song and
      the jest were exchanged&mdash;the stories of former deeds were told with
      advantage; and at length, and while boasting of their successful
      infraction of the laws, no one recollected they were speaking in presence
      of their natural guardian. The merry King, nothing heeding his dignity any
      more than his company, laughed, quaffed, and jested among the jolly band.
      The natural and rough sense of Robin Hood led him to be desirous that the
      scene should be closed ere any thing should occur to disturb its harmony,
      the more especially that he observed Ivanhoe's brow clouded with anxiety.
      &ldquo;We are honoured,&rdquo; he said to Ivanhoe, apart, &ldquo;by the presence of our
      gallant Sovereign; yet I would not that he dallied with time, which the
      circumstances of his kingdom may render precious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well and wisely spoken, brave Robin Hood,&rdquo; said Wilfred, apart;
      &ldquo;and know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty even in its gayest
      mood are but toying with the lion's whelp, which, on slight provocation,
      uses both fangs and claws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have touched the very cause of my fear,&rdquo; said the Outlaw; &ldquo;my men are
      rough by practice and nature, the King is hasty as well as good-humoured;
      nor know I how soon cause of offence may arise, or how warmly it may be
      received&mdash;it is time this revel were broken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be by your management then, gallant yeoman,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;for
      each hint I have essayed to give him serves only to induce him to prolong
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I so soon risk the pardon and favour of my Sovereign?&rdquo; said Robin
      Hood, pausing for all instant; &ldquo;but by Saint Christopher, it shall be so.
      I were undeserving his grace did I not peril it for his good.&mdash;Here,
      Scathlock, get thee behind yonder thicket, and wind me a Norman blast on
      thy bugle, and without an instant's delay on peril of your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the revellers
      were startled by the sound of his horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the bugle of Malvoisin,&rdquo; said the Miller, starting to his feet, and
      seizing his bow. The Friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his
      quarter-staff. Wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook
      himself to sword and target. All the others stood to their weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet to
      the battle; and, to Richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of
      pleasure. He called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his
      armour, which he had laid aside; and while Gurth was putting them on, he
      laid his strict injunctions on Wilfred, under pain of his highest
      displeasure, not to engage in the skirmish which he supposed was
      approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast fought for me an hundred times, Wilfred,&mdash;and I have seen
      it. Thou shalt this day look on, and see how Richard will fight for his
      friend and liegeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Robin Hood had sent off several of his followers in
      different directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and when he saw the
      company effectually broken up, he approached Richard, who was now
      completely armed, and, kneeling down on one knee, craved pardon of his
      Sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what, good yeoman?&rdquo; said Richard, somewhat impatiently. &ldquo;Have we not
      already granted thee a full pardon for all transgressions? Thinkest thou
      our word is a feather, to be blown backward and forward between us? Thou
      canst not have had time to commit any new offence since that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but I have though,&rdquo; answered the yeoman, &ldquo;if it be an offence to
      deceive my prince for his own advantage. The bugle you have heard was none
      of Malvoisin's, but blown by my direction, to break off the banquet, lest
      it trenched upon hours of dearer import than to be thus dallied with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then rose from his knee, folded his arm on his bosom, and in a manner
      rather respectful than submissive, awaited the answer of the King,&mdash;like
      one who is conscious he may have given offence, yet is confident in the
      rectitude of his motive. The blood rushed in anger to the countenance of
      Richard; but it was the first transient emotion, and his sense of justice
      instantly subdued it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King of Sherwood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;grudges his venison and his wine-flask
      to the King of England? It is well, bold Robin!&mdash;but when you come to
      see me in merry London, I trust to be a less niggard host. Thou art right,
      however, good fellow. Let us therefore to horse and away&mdash;Wilfred has
      been impatient this hour. Tell me, bold Robin, hast thou never a friend in
      thy band, who, not content with advising, will needs direct thy motions,
      and look miserable when thou dost presume to act for thyself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a one,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;is my Lieutenant, Little John, who is even now
      absent on an expedition as far as the borders of Scotland; and I will own
      to your Majesty, that I am sometimes displeased by the freedom of his
      councils&mdash;but, when I think twice, I cannot be long angry with one
      who can have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his master's
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art right, good yeoman,&rdquo; answered Richard; &ldquo;and if I had Ivanhoe, on
      the one hand, to give grave advice, and recommend it by the sad gravity of
      his brow, and thee, on the other, to trick me into what thou thinkest my
      own good, I should have as little the freedom of mine own will as any king
      in Christendom or Heathenesse.&mdash;But come, sirs, let us merrily on to
      Coningsburgh, and think no more on't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robin Hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction of
      the road they were to pass, who would not fail to discover and apprize
      them of any secret ambuscade; and that he had little doubt they would find
      the ways secure, or, if otherwise, would receive such timely notice of the
      danger as would enable them to fall back on a strong troop of archers,
      with which he himself proposed to follow on the same route.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched
      Richard's feelings, and removed any slight grudge which he might retain on
      account of the deception the Outlaw Captain had practised upon him. He
      once more extended his hand to Robin Hood, assured him of his full pardon
      and future favour, as well as his firm resolution to restrain the
      tyrannical exercise of the forest rights and other oppressive laws, by
      which so many English yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion. But
      Richard's good intentions towards the bold Outlaw were frustrated by the
      King's untimely death; and the Charter of the Forest was extorted from the
      unwilling hands of King John when he succeeded to his heroic brother. As
      for the rest of Robin Hood's career, as well as the tale of his
      treacherous death, they are to be found in those black-letter garlands,
      once sold at the low and easy rate of one halfpenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Outlaw's opinion proved true; and the King, attended by Ivanhoe,
      Gurth, and Wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the
      Castle of Coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few more beautiful or striking scenes in England, than are
      presented by the vicinity of this ancient Saxon fortress. The soft and
      gentle river Don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is
      richly blended with woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the river,
      well defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient edifice, which, as
      its Saxon name implies, was, previous to the Conquest, a royal residence
      of the kings of England. The outer walls have probably been added by the
      Normans, but the inner keep bears token of very great antiquity. It is
      situated on a mount at one angle of the inner court, and forms a complete
      circle of perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter. The wall is of immense
      thickness, and is propped or defended by six huge external buttresses
      which project from the circle, and rise up against the sides of the tower
      as if to strengthen or to support it. These massive buttresses are solid
      when they arise from the foundation, and a good way higher up; but are
      hollowed out towards the top, and terminate in a sort of turrets
      communicating with the interior of the keep itself. The distant appearance
      of this huge building, with these singular accompaniments, is as
      interesting to the lovers of the picturesque, as the interior of the
      castle is to the eager antiquary, whose imagination it carries back to the
      days of the Heptarchy. A barrow, in the vicinity of the castle, is pointed
      out as the tomb of the memorable Hengist; and various monuments, of great
      antiquity and curiosity, are shown in the neighbouring churchyard. <a
      href="#linknote-57" name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57"><small>57</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When Coeur-de-Lion and his retinue approached this rude yet stately
      building, it was not, as at present, surrounded by external
      fortifications. The Saxon architect had exhausted his art in rendering the
      main keep defensible, and there was no other circumvallation than a rude
      barrier of palisades.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge black banner, which floated from the top of the tower, announced
      that the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act of being
      solemnized. It bore no emblem of the deceased's birth or quality, for
      armorial bearings were then a novelty among the Norman chivalry themselves
      and, were totally unknown to the Saxons. But above the gate was another
      banner, on which the figure of a white horse, rudely painted, indicated
      the nation and rank of the deceased, by the well-known symbol of Hengist
      and his Saxon warriors.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral
      banquets were times of general and profuse hospitality, which not only
      every one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased,
      but all passengers whatsoever, were invited to partake. The wealth and
      consequence of the deceased Athelstane, occasioned this custom to be
      observed in the fullest extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the hill
      on which the castle was situated; and when the King and his attendants
      entered the open and unguarded gates of the external barrier, the space
      within presented a scene not easily reconciled with the cause of the
      assemblage. In one place cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen, and fat
      sheep; in another, hogsheads of ale were set abroach, to be drained at the
      freedom of all comers. Groups of every description were to be seen
      devouring the food and swallowing the liquor thus abandoned to their
      discretion. The naked Saxon serf was drowning the sense of his half-year's
      hunger and thirst, in one day of gluttony and drunkenness&mdash;the more
      pampered burgess and guild-brother was eating his morsel with gust, or
      curiously criticising the quantity of the malt and the skill of the
      brewer. Some few of the poorer Norman gentry might also be seen,
      distinguished by their shaven chins and short cloaks, and not less so by
      their keeping together, and looking with great scorn on the whole
      solemnity, even while condescending to avail themselves of the good cheer
      which was so liberally supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with strolling
      soldiers returned from Palestine, (according to their own account at
      least,) pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling mechanics were
      enquiring after employment, and wandering palmers, hedge-priests, Saxon
      minstrels, and Welsh bards, were muttering prayers, and extracting
      mistuned dirges from their harps, crowds, and rotes. <a href="#linknote-58"      name="linknoteref-58" id="linknoteref-58"><small>58</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      One sent forth the praises of Athelstane in a doleful panegyric; another,
      in a Saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth and harsh names of his
      noble ancestry. Jesters and jugglers were not awanting, nor was the
      occasion of the assembly supposed to render the exercise of their
      profession indecorous or improper. Indeed the ideas of the Saxons on these
      occasions were as natural as they were rude. If sorrow was thirsty, there
      was drink&mdash;if hungry, there was food&mdash;if it sunk down upon and
      saddened the heart, here were the means supplied of mirth, or at least of
      amusement. Nor did the assistants scorn to avail themselves of those means
      of consolation, although, every now and then, as if suddenly recollecting
      the cause which had brought them together, the men groaned in unison,
      while the females, of whom many were present, raised up their voices and
      shrieked for very woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the scene in the castle-yard at Coningsburgh when it was entered
      by Richard and his followers. The seneschal or steward deigned not to take
      notice of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually entering and
      withdrawing, unless so far as was necessary to preserve order;
      nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the Monarch and Ivanhoe,
      more especially as he imagined the features of the latter were familiar to
      him. Besides, the approach of two knights, for such their dress bespoke
      them, was a rare event at a Saxon solemnity, and could not but be regarded
      as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family. And in his sable
      dress, and holding in his hand his white wand of office, this important
      personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage of guests, thus
      conducting Richard and Ivanhoe to the entrance of the tower. Gurth and
      Wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard, nor presumed to
      intrude themselves any farther until their presence should be required.

      CHAPTER XLII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I found them winding of Marcello's corpse.
     And there was such a solemn melody,
     'Twixt doleful songs, tears, and sad elegies,&mdash;
     Such as old grandames, watching by the dead,
     Are wont to outwear the night with.
     &mdash;Old Play
</pre>
    <p>
      The mode of entering the great tower of Coningsburgh Castle is very
      peculiar, and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early times in which
      it was erected. A flight of steps, so deep and narrow as to be almost
      precipitous, leads up to a low portal in the south side of the tower, by
      which the adventurous antiquary may still, or at least could a few years
      since, gain access to a small stair within the thickness of the main wall
      of the tower, which leads up to the third story of the building,&mdash;the
      two lower being dungeons or vaults, which neither receive air nor light,
      save by a square hole in the third story, with which they seem to have
      communicated by a ladder. The access to the upper apartments in the tower
      which consist in all of four stories, is given by stairs which are carried
      up through the external buttresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this difficult and complicated entrance, the good King Richard,
      followed by his faithful Ivanhoe, was ushered into the round apartment
      which occupies the whole of the third story from the ground. Wilfred, by
      the difficulties of the ascent, gained time to muffle his face in his
      mantle, as it had been held expedient that he should not present himself
      to his father until the King should give him the signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were assembled in this apartment, around a large oaken table, about
      a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the Saxon families in
      the adjacent counties. They were all old, or, at least, elderly men; for
      the younger race, to the great displeasure of the seniors, had, like
      Ivanhoe, broken down many of the barriers which separated for half a
      century the Norman victors from the vanquished Saxons. The downcast and
      sorrowful looks of these venerable men, their silence and their mournful
      posture, formed a strong contrast to the levity of the revellers on the
      outside of the castle. Their grey locks and long full beards, together
      with their antique tunics and loose black mantles, suited well with the
      singular and rude apartment in which they were seated, and gave the
      appearance of a band of ancient worshippers of Woden, recalled to life to
      mourn over the decay of their national glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cedric, seated in equal rank among his countrymen, seemed yet, by common
      consent, to act as chief of the assembly. Upon the entrance of Richard
      (only known to him as the valorous Knight of the Fetterlock) he arose
      gravely, and gave him welcome by the ordinary salutation, &ldquo;Waes hael&rdquo;,
      raising at the same time a goblet to his head. The King, no stranger to
      the customs of his English subjects, returned the greeting with the
      appropriate words, &ldquo;Drinc hael&rdquo;, and partook of a cup which was handed to
      him by the sewer. The same courtesy was offered to Ivanhoe, who pledged
      his father in silence, supplying the usual speech by an inclination of his
      head, lest his voice should have been recognised.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this introductory ceremony was performed, Cedric arose, and,
      extending his hand to Richard, conducted him into a small and very rude
      chapel, which was excavated, as it were, out of one of the external
      buttresses. As there was no opening, saving a little narrow loop-hole, the
      place would have been nearly quite dark but for two flambeaux or torches,
      which showed, by a red and smoky light, the arched roof and naked walls,
      the rude altar of stone, and the crucifix of the same material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this altar was placed a bier, and on each side of this bier kneeled
      three priests, who told their beads, and muttered their prayers, with the
      greatest signs of external devotion. For this service a splendid
      &ldquo;soul-scat&rdquo; was paid to the convent of Saint Edmund's by the mother of the
      deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole brethren, saving
      the lame Sacristan, had transferred themselves to Coningsburgh, where,
      while six of their number were constantly on guard in the performance of
      divine rites by the bier of Athelstane, the others failed not to take
      their share of the refreshments and amusements which went on at the
      castle. In maintaining this pious watch and ward, the good monks were
      particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for an instant, lest
      Zernebock, the ancient Saxon Apollyon, should lay his clutches on the
      departed Athelstane. Nor were they less careful to prevent any unhallowed
      layman from touching the pall, which, having been that used at the funeral
      of Saint Edmund, was liable to be desecrated, if handled by the profane.
      If, in truth, these attentions could be of any use to the deceased, he had
      some right to expect them at the hands of the brethren of Saint Edmund's,
      since, besides a hundred mancuses of gold paid down as the soul-ransom,
      the mother of Athelstane had announced her intention of endowing that
      foundation with the better part of the lands of the deceased, in order to
      maintain perpetual prayers for his soul, and that of her departed husband.
      Richard and Wilfred followed the Saxon Cedric into the apartment of death,
      where, as their guide pointed with solemn air to the untimely bier of
      Athelstane, they followed his example in devoutly crossing themselves, and
      muttering a brief prayer for the weal of the departed soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      This act of pious charity performed, Cedric again motioned them to follow
      him, gliding over the stone floor with a noiseless tread; and, after
      ascending a few steps, opened with great caution the door of a small
      oratory, which adjoined to the chapel. It was about eight feet square,
      hollowed, like the chapel itself, out of the thickness of the wall; and
      the loop-hole, which enlightened it, being to the west, and widening
      considerably as it sloped inward, a beam of the setting sun found its way
      into its dark recess, and showed a female of a dignified mien, and whose
      countenance retained the marked remains of majestic beauty. Her long
      mourning robes and her flowing wimple of black cypress, enhanced the
      whiteness of her skin, and the beauty of her light-coloured and flowing
      tresses, which time had neither thinned nor mingled with silver. Her
      countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that is consistent with
      resignation. On the stone table before her stood a crucifix of ivory,
      beside which was laid a missal, having its pages richly illuminated, and
      its boards adorned with clasps of gold, and bosses of the same precious
      metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble Edith,&rdquo; said Cedric, after having stood a moment silent, as if to
      give Richard and Wilfred time to look upon the lady of the mansion, &ldquo;these
      are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. And this, in
      especial, is the valiant Knight who fought so bravely for the deliverance
      of him for whom we this day mourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His bravery has my thanks,&rdquo; returned the lady; &ldquo;although it be the will
      of Heaven that it should be displayed in vain. I thank, too, his courtesy,
      and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to behold the
      widow of Adeling, the mother of Athelstane, in her deep hour of sorrow and
      lamentation. To your care, kind kinsman, I intrust them, satisfied that
      they will want no hospitality which these sad walls can yet afford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their
      hospitable guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size with
      that which they had first entered, occupying indeed the story immediately
      above. From this room, ere yet the door was opened, proceeded a low and
      melancholy strain of vocal music. When they entered, they found themselves
      in the presence of about twenty matrons and maidens of distinguished Saxon
      lineage. Four maidens, Rowena leading the choir, raised a hymn for the
      soul of the deceased, of which we have only been able to decipher two or
      three stanzas:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Dust unto dust,
     To this all must;
     The tenant hath resign'd
     The faded form
     To waste and worm&mdash;
     Corruption claims her kind.

     Through paths unknown
     Thy soul hath flown,
     To seek the realms of woe,
     Where fiery pain
     Shall purge the stain
     Of actions done below.

     In that sad place,
     By Mary's grace,
     Brief may thy dwelling be
     Till prayers and alms,
     And holy psalms,
     Shall set the captive free.
</pre>
    <p>
      While this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female
      choristers, the others were divided into two bands, of which one was
      engaged in bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste could
      compass, a large silken pall, destined to cover the bier of Athelstane,
      while the others busied themselves in selecting, from baskets of flowers
      placed before them, garlands, which they intended for the same mournful
      purpose. The behaviour of the maidens was decorous, if not marked with
      deep affliction; but now and then a whisper or a smile called forth the
      rebuke of the severer matrons, and here and there might be seen a damsel
      more interested in endeavouring to find out how her mourning-robe became
      her, than in the dismal ceremony for which they were preparing. Neither
      was this propensity (if we must needs confess the truth) at all diminished
      by the appearance of two strange knights, which occasioned some looking
      up, peeping, and whispering. Rowena alone, too proud to be vain, paid her
      greeting to her deliverer with a graceful courtesy. Her demeanour was
      serious, but not dejected; and it may be doubted whether thoughts of
      Ivanhoe, and of the uncertainty of his fate, did not claim as great a
      share in her gravity as the death of her kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably
      clear-sighted on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemed so much
      deeper than any of the other maidens, that he deemed it proper to whisper
      the explanation&mdash;&ldquo;She was the affianced bride of the noble
      Athelstane.&rdquo;&mdash;It may be doubted whether this communication went a far
      way to increase Wilfred's disposition to sympathize with the mourners of
      Coningsburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in
      which the obsequies of Athelstane were celebrated under different forms,
      Cedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them,
      for the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests, whose more slight
      connexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to join those who
      were immediately effected by the unhappy event. He assured them of every
      accommodation, and was about to withdraw when the Black Knight took his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave to remind you, noble Thane,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that when we last parted,
      you promised, for the service I had the fortune to render you, to grant me
      a boon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is granted ere named, noble Knight,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;yet, at this sad
      moment&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that also,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;I have bethought me&mdash;but my time is
      brief&mdash;neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the grave
      on the noble Athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and
      hasty opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight of the Fetterlock,&rdquo; said Cedric, colouring, and interrupting
      the King in his turn, &ldquo;I trust your boon regards yourself and no other;
      for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce fitting
      that a stranger should mingle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I wish to mingle,&rdquo; said the King, mildly, &ldquo;unless in so far as you
      will admit me to have an interest. As yet you have known me but as the
      Black Knight of the Fetterlock&mdash;Know me now as Richard Plantagenet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard of Anjou!&rdquo; exclaimed Cedric, stepping backward with the utmost
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, noble Cedric&mdash;Richard of England!&mdash;whose deepest interest&mdash;whose
      deepest wish, is to see her sons united with each other.&mdash;And, how
      now, worthy Thane! hast thou no knee for thy prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Norman blood,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;it hath never bended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reserve thine homage then,&rdquo; said the Monarch, &ldquo;until I shall prove my
      right to it by my equal protection of Normans and English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; answered Cedric, &ldquo;I have ever done justice to thy bravery and
      thy worth&mdash;Nor am I ignorant of thy claim to the crown through thy
      descent from Matilda, niece to Edgar Atheling, and daughter to Malcolm of
      Scotland. But Matilda, though of the royal Saxon blood, was not the heir
      to the monarchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not dispute my title with thee, noble Thane,&rdquo; said Richard,
      calmly; &ldquo;but I will bid thee look around thee, and see where thou wilt
      find another to be put into the scale against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hast thou wandered hither, Prince, to tell me so?&rdquo; said Cedric&mdash;&ldquo;To
      upbraid me with the ruin of my race, ere the grave has closed o'er the
      last scion of Saxon royalty?&rdquo;&mdash;His countenance darkened as he spoke.&mdash;&ldquo;It
      was boldly&mdash;it was rashly done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, by the holy rood!&rdquo; replied the King; &ldquo;it was done in the frank
      confidence which one brave man may repose in another, without a shadow of
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou sayest well, Sir King&mdash;for King I own thou art, and wilt be,
      despite of my feeble opposition.&mdash;I dare not take the only mode to
      prevent it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my
      reach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now to my boon,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;which I ask not with one jot the
      less confidence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful
      sovereignty. I require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being
      held faithless, man-sworn, and 'nidering', <a href="#linknote-581"      name="linknoteref-581" id="linknoteref-581"><small>581</small></a> to
      forgive and receive to thy paternal affection the good knight, Wilfred of
      Ivanhoe. In this reconciliation thou wilt own I have an interest&mdash;the
      happiness of my friend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is Wilfred!&rdquo; said Cedric, pointing to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&mdash;my father!&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, prostrating himself at
      Cedric's feet, &ldquo;grant me thy forgiveness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast it, my son,&rdquo; said Cedric, raising him up. &ldquo;The son of Hereward
      knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to a Norman. But
      let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy English ancestry&mdash;no
      short cloaks, no gay bonnets, no fantastic plumage in my decent household.
      He that would be the son of Cedric, must show himself of English ancestry.&mdash;Thou
      art about to speak,&rdquo; he added, sternly, &ldquo;and I guess the topic. The Lady
      Rowena must complete two years' mourning, as for a betrothed husband&mdash;all
      our Saxon ancestors would disown us were we to treat of a new union for
      her ere the grave of him she should have wedded&mdash;him, so much the
      most worthy of her hand by birth and ancestry&mdash;is yet closed. The
      ghost of Athelstane himself would burst his bloody cerements and stand
      before us to forbid such dishonour to his memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if Cedric's words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had he
      uttered them ere the door flew open, and Athelstane, arrayed in the
      garments of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like
      something arisen from the dead! <a href="#linknote-59"      name="linknoteref-59" id="linknoteref-59"><small>59</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly
      appalling. Cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment would
      permit, and, leaning against it as one unable to support himself, gazed on
      the figure of his friend with eyes that seemed fixed, and a mouth which he
      appeared incapable of shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself, repeating prayers
      in Saxon, Latin, or Norman-French, as they occurred to his memory, while
      Richard alternately said, &ldquo;Benedicite&rdquo;, and swore, &ldquo;Mort de ma vie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying,
      &ldquo;Secure the treacherous monks!&rdquo;&mdash;others, &ldquo;Down with them into the
      dungeon!&rdquo;&mdash;others, &ldquo;Pitch them from the highest battlements!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of God!&rdquo; said Cedric, addressing what seemed the spectre of
      his departed friend, &ldquo;if thou art mortal, speak!&mdash;if a departed
      spirit, say for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if I can do aught that
      can set thy spirit at repose.&mdash;Living or dead, noble Athelstane,
      speak to Cedric!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the spectre, very composedly, &ldquo;when I have collected
      breath, and when you give me time&mdash;Alive, saidst thou?&mdash;I am as
      much alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days,
      which seem three ages&mdash;Yes, bread and water, Father Cedric! By
      Heaven, and all saints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for
      three livelong days, and by God's providence it is that I am now here to
      tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said the Black Knight, &ldquo;I myself saw you struck
      down by the fierce Templar towards the end of the storm at Torquilstone,
      and as I thought, and Wamba reported, your skull was cloven through the
      teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought amiss, Sir Knight,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;and Wamba lied. My
      teeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently find&mdash;No
      thanks to the Templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so that the
      blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good mace
      with which I warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, I had not valued
      it a rush, and had dealt him such a counter-buff as would have spoilt his
      retreat. But as it was, down I went, stunned, indeed, but unwounded.
      Others, of both sides, were beaten down and slaughtered above me, so that
      I never recovered my senses until I found myself in a coffin&mdash;(an
      open one, by good luck)&mdash;placed before the altar of the church of
      Saint Edmund's. I sneezed repeatedly&mdash;groaned&mdash;awakened and
      would have arisen, when the Sacristan and Abbot, full of terror, came
      running at the noise, surprised, doubtless, and no way pleased to find the
      man alive, whose heirs they had proposed themselves to be. I asked for
      wine&mdash;they gave me some, but it must have been highly medicated, for
      I slept yet more deeply than before, and wakened not for many hours. I
      found my arms swathed down&mdash;my feet tied so fast that mine ankles
      ache at the very remembrance&mdash;the place was utterly dark&mdash;the
      oubliette, as I suppose, of their accursed convent, and from the close,
      stifled, damp smell, I conceive it is also used for a place of sepulture.
      I had strange thoughts of what had befallen me, when the door of my
      dungeon creaked, and two villain monks entered. They would have persuaded
      me I was in purgatory, but I knew too well the pursy short-breathed voice
      of the Father Abbot.&mdash;Saint Jeremy! how different from that tone with
      which he used to ask me for another slice of the haunch!&mdash;the dog has
      feasted with me from Christmas to Twelfth-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;take breath&mdash;tell
      your story at leisure&mdash;beshrew me but such a tale is as well worth
      listening to as a romance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay but, by the rood of Bromeholm, there was no romance in the matter!&rdquo;
       said Athelstane.&mdash;&ldquo;A barley loaf and a pitcher of water&mdash;that
      THEY gave me, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and I myself, had
      enriched, when their best resources were the flitches of bacon and
      measures of corn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in
      exchange for their prayers&mdash;the nest of foul ungrateful vipers&mdash;barley
      bread and ditch water to such a patron as I had been! I will smoke them
      out of their nest, though I be excommunicated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in the name of Our Lady, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said Cedric, grasping
      the hand of his friend, &ldquo;how didst thou escape this imminent danger&mdash;did
      their hearts relent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did their hearts relent!&rdquo; echoed Athelstane.&mdash;&ldquo;Do rocks melt with
      the sun? I should have been there still, had not some stir in the Convent,
      which I find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast, when
      they well knew how and where I had been buried alive, summoned the swarm
      out of their hive. I heard them droning out their death-psalms, little
      judging they were sung in respect for my soul by those who were thus
      famishing my body. They went, however, and I waited long for food&mdash;no
      wonder&mdash;the gouty Sacristan was even too busy with his own provender
      to mind mine. At length down he came, with an unstable step and a strong
      flavour of wine and spices about his person. Good cheer had opened his
      heart, for he left me a nook of pasty and a flask of wine, instead of my
      former fare. I ate, drank, and was invigorated; when, to add to my good
      luck, the Sacristan, too totty to discharge his duty of turnkey fitly,
      locked the door beside the staple, so that it fell ajar. The light, the
      food, the wine, set my invention to work. The staple to which my chains
      were fixed, was more rusted than I or the villain Abbot had supposed. Even
      iron could not remain without consuming in the damps of that infernal
      dungeon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take breath, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and partake of some
      refreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partake!&rdquo; quoth Athelstane; &ldquo;I have been partaking five times to-day&mdash;and
      yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether foreign to the
      matter; and I pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their
      resuscitated landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:&mdash;He had
      indeed now many more auditors than those to whom it was commenced, for
      Edith, having given certain necessary orders for arranging matters within
      the Castle, had followed the dead-alive up to the stranger's apartment
      attended by as many of the guests, male and female, as could squeeze into
      the small room, while others, crowding the staircase, caught up an
      erroneous edition of the story, and transmitted it still more inaccurately
      to those beneath, who again sent it forth to the vulgar without, in a
      fashion totally irreconcilable to the real fact. Athelstane, however, went
      on as follows, with the history of his escape:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finding myself freed from the staple, I dragged myself up stairs as well
      as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting, might; and
      after much groping about, I was at length directed, by the sound of a
      jolly roundelay, to the apartment where the worthy Sacristan, an it so
      please ye, was holding a devil's mass with a huge beetle-browed,
      broad-shouldered brother of the grey-frock and cowl, who looked much more
      like a thief than a clergyman. I burst in upon them, and the fashion of my
      grave-clothes, as well as the clanking of my chains, made me more resemble
      an inhabitant of the other world than of this. Both stood aghast; but when
      I knocked down the Sacristan with my fist, the other fellow, his
      pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a huge quarter-staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be our Friar Tuck, for a count's ransom,&rdquo; said Richard, looking
      at Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be the devil, an he will,&rdquo; said Athelstane. &ldquo;Fortunately he missed
      the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with him, took to his heels and
      ran for it. I failed not to set my own heels at liberty by means of the
      fetter-key, which hung amongst others at the sexton's belt; and I had
      thoughts of beating out the knave's brains with the bunch of keys, but
      gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of wine which the rascal had
      imparted to my captivity, came over my heart; so, with a brace of hearty
      kicks, I left him on the floor, pouched some baked meat, and a leathern
      bottle of wine, with which the two venerable brethren had been regaling,
      went to the stable, and found in a private stall mine own best palfrey,
      which, doubtless, had been set apart for the holy Father Abbot's
      particular use. Hither I came with all the speed the beast could compass&mdash;man
      and mother's son flying before me wherever I came, taking me for a
      spectre, the more especially as, to prevent my being recognised, I drew
      the corpse-hood over my face. I had not gained admittance into my own
      castle, had I not been supposed to be the attendant of a juggler who is
      making the people in the castle-yard very merry, considering they are
      assembled to celebrate their lord's funeral&mdash;I say the sewer thought
      I was dressed to bear a part in the tregetour's mummery, and so I got
      admission, and did but disclose myself to my mother, and eat a hasty
      morsel, ere I came in quest of you, my noble friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have found me,&rdquo; said Cedric, &ldquo;ready to resume our brave projects
      of honour and liberty. I tell thee, never will dawn a morrow so auspicious
      as the next, for the deliverance of the noble Saxon race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not to me of delivering any one,&rdquo; said Athelstane; &ldquo;it is well I am
      delivered myself. I am more intent on punishing that villain Abbot. He
      shall hang on the top of this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope and
      stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, I will
      have him craned up from without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my son,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;consider his sacred office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider my three days' fast,&rdquo; replied Athelstane; &ldquo;I will have their
      blood every one of them. Front-de-Boeuf was burnt alive for a less matter,
      for he kept a good table for his prisoners, only put too much garlic in
      his last dish of pottage. But these hypocritical, ungrateful slaves, so
      often the self-invited flatterers at my board, who gave me neither pottage
      nor garlic, more or less, they die, by the soul of Hengist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Pope, my noble friend,&rdquo;&mdash;said Cedric&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the devil, my noble friend,&rdquo;&mdash;answered Athelstane; &ldquo;they die,
      and no more of them. Were they the best monks upon earth, the world would
      go on without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, noble Athelstane,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;forget such wretches in the
      career of glory which lies open before thee. Tell this Norman prince,
      Richard of Anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not hold
      undisputed the throne of Alfred, while a male descendant of the Holy
      Confessor lives to dispute it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;is this the noble King Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Richard Plantagenet himself,&rdquo; said Cedric; &ldquo;yet I need not remind
      thee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neither be injured
      nor detained prisoner&mdash;thou well knowest thy duty to him as his
      host.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, by my faith!&rdquo; said Athelstane; &ldquo;and my duty as a subject besides, for
      I here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;think on thy royal rights!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think on the freedom of England, degenerate Prince!&rdquo; said Cedric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother and friend,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;a truce to your upbraidings&mdash;bread
      and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of ambition, and I rise
      from the tomb a wiser man than I descended into it. One half of those vain
      follies were puffed into mine ear by that perfidious Abbot Wolfram, and
      you may now judge if he is a counsellor to be trusted. Since these plots
      were set in agitation, I have had nothing but hurried journeys,
      indigestions, blows and bruises, imprisonments and starvation; besides
      that they can only end in the murder of some thousands of quiet folk. I
      tell you, I will be king in my own domains, and nowhere else; and my first
      act of dominion shall be to hang the Abbot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my ward Rowena,&rdquo; said Cedric&mdash;&ldquo;I trust you intend not to desert
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Cedric,&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;be reasonable. The Lady Rowena cares
      not for me&mdash;she loves the little finger of my kinsman Wilfred's glove
      better than my whole person. There she stands to avouch it&mdash;Nay,
      blush not, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better
      than a country franklin&mdash;and do not laugh neither, Rowena, for
      grave-clothes and a thin visage are, God knows, no matter of merriment&mdash;Nay,
      an thou wilt needs laugh, I will find thee a better jest&mdash;Give me thy
      hand, or rather lend it me, for I but ask it in the way of friendship.&mdash;Here,
      cousin Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in thy favour I renounce and abjure&mdash;-Hey!
      by Saint Dunstan, our cousin Wilfred hath vanished!&mdash;Yet, unless my
      eyes are still dazzled with the fasting I have undergone, I saw him stand
      there but even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All now looked around and enquired for Ivanhoe, but he had vanished. It
      was at length discovered that a Jew had been to seek him; and that, after
      very brief conference, he had called for Gurth and his armour, and had
      left the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair cousin,&rdquo; said Athelstane to Rowena, &ldquo;could I think that this sudden
      disappearance of Ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the weightiest
      reason, I would myself resume&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that Ivanhoe had
      disappeared, than Rowena, who had found her situation extremely
      embarrassing, had taken the first opportunity to escape from the
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; quoth Athelstane, &ldquo;women are the least to be trusted of all
      animals, monks and abbots excepted. I am an infidel, if I expected not
      thanks from her, and perhaps a kiss to boot&mdash;These cursed
      grave-clothes have surely a spell on them, every one flies from me.&mdash;To
      you I turn, noble King Richard, with the vows of allegiance, which, as a
      liege-subject&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But King Richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. At length it was
      learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his presence
      the Jew who had spoken with Ivanhoe, and after a moment's speech with him,
      had called vehemently to horse, thrown himself upon a steed, compelled the
      Jew to mount another, and set off at a rate, which, according to Wamba,
      rendered the old Jew's neck not worth a penny's purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my halidome!&rdquo; said Athelstane, &ldquo;it is certain that Zernebock hath
      possessed himself of my castle in my absence. I return in my
      grave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one I
      speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice!&mdash;But it skills not
      talking of it. Come, my friends&mdash;such of you as are left, follow me
      to the banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear&mdash;it is, I trust,
      as yet tolerably furnished, as becomes the obsequies of an ancient Saxon
      noble; and should we tarry any longer, who knows but the devil may fly off
      with the supper?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XLIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
     That they may break his foaming courser's back,
     And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
     A caitiff recreant!
     &mdash;Richard II
</pre>
    <p>
      Our scene now returns to the exterior of the Castle, or Preceptory, of
      Templestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the
      life or death of Rebecca. It was a scene of bustle and life, as if the
      whole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake, or
      rural feast. But the earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not
      peculiar to those dark ages; though in the gladiatorial exercise of single
      combat and general tourney, they were habituated to the bloody spectacle
      of brave men falling by each other's hands. Even in our own days, when
      morals are better understood, an execution, a bruising match, a riot, or a
      meeting of radical reformers, collects, at considerable hazard to
      themselves, immense crowds of spectators, otherwise little interested,
      except to see how matters are to be conducted, or whether the heroes of
      the day are, in the heroic language of insurgent tailors, flints or
      dunghills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes, therefore, of a very considerable multitude, were bent on the
      gate of the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose of witnessing the
      procession; while still greater numbers had already surrounded the
      tiltyard belonging to that establishment. This enclosure was formed on a
      piece of level ground adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been levelled
      with care, for the exercise of military and chivalrous sports. It occupied
      the brow of a soft and gentle eminence, was carefully palisaded around,
      and, as the Templars willingly invited spectators to be witnesses of their
      skill in feats of chivalry, was amply supplied with galleries and benches
      for their use.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion, a throne was erected for the Grand Master at the
      east end, surrounded with seats of distinction for the Preceptors and
      Knights of the Order. Over these floated the sacred standard, called &ldquo;Le
      Beau-seant&rdquo;, which was the ensign, as its name was the battle-cry, of the
      Templars.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots, so arranged around
      a stake, deeply fixed in the ground, as to leave a space for the victim
      whom they were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal circle, in
      order to be chained to the stake by the fetters which hung ready for that
      purpose. Beside this deadly apparatus stood four black slaves, whose
      colour and African features, then so little known in England, appalled the
      multitude, who gazed on them as on demons employed about their own
      diabolical exercises. These men stirred not, excepting now and then, under
      the direction of one who seemed their chief, to shift and replace the
      ready fuel. They looked not on the multitude. In fact, they seemed
      insensible of their presence, and of every thing save the discharge of
      their own horrible duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when, in speech with each other, they expanded their blubber lips, and
      showed their white fangs, as if they grinned at the thoughts of the
      expected tragedy, the startled commons could scarcely help believing that
      they were actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had communed,
      and who, her time being out, stood ready to assist in her dreadful
      punishment. They whispered to each other, and communicated all the feats
      which Satan had performed during that busy and unhappy period, not
      failing, of course, to give the devil rather more than his due.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not heard, Father Dennet,&rdquo; quoth one boor to another advanced in
      years, &ldquo;that the devil has carried away bodily the great Saxon Thane,
      Athelstane of Coningsburgh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of God and Saint
      Dunstan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green cassock
      embroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a harp
      upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. The Minstrel seemed of no
      vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of his gaily braidered doublet, he
      wore around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the &ldquo;wrest&rdquo;, or key,
      with which he tuned his harp. On his right arm was a silver plate, which,
      instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or badge of the baron to
      whose family he belonged, had barely the word SHERWOOD engraved upon it.&mdash;&ldquo;How
      mean you by that?&rdquo; said the gay Minstrel, mingling in the conversation of
      the peasants; &ldquo;I came to seek one subject for my rhyme, and, by'r Lady, I
      were glad to find two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well avouched,&rdquo; said the elder peasant, &ldquo;that after Athelstane of
      Coningsburgh had been dead four weeks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; said the Minstrel; &ldquo;I saw him in life at the Passage
      of Arms at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead, however, he was, or else translated,&rdquo; said the younger peasant;
      &ldquo;for I heard the Monks of Saint Edmund's singing the death's hymn for him;
      and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole at the Castle of
      Coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had I gone, but for Mabel Parkins,
      who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, dead was Athelstane,&rdquo; said the old man, shaking his head, &ldquo;and the
      more pity it was, for the old Saxon blood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, your story, my masters&mdash;your story,&rdquo; said the Minstrel,
      somewhat impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay&mdash;construe us the story,&rdquo; said a burly Friar, who stood beside
      them, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a pilgrim's
      staff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when occasion
      served,&mdash;&ldquo;Your story,&rdquo; said the stalwart churchman; &ldquo;burn not
      daylight about it&mdash;we have short time to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An please your reverence,&rdquo; said Dennet, &ldquo;a drunken priest came to visit
      the Sacristan at Saint Edmund's&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not please my reverence,&rdquo; answered the churchman, &ldquo;that there
      should be such an animal as a drunken priest, or, if there were, that a
      layman should so speak him. Be mannerly, my friend, and conclude the holy
      man only wrapt in meditation, which makes the head dizzy and foot
      unsteady, as if the stomach were filled with new wine&mdash;I have felt it
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; answered Father Dennet, &ldquo;a holy brother came to visit the
      Sacristan at Saint Edmund's&mdash;a sort of hedge-priest is the visitor,
      and kills half the deer that are stolen in the forest, who loves the
      tinkling of a pint-pot better than the sacring-bell, and deems a flitch of
      bacon worth ten of his breviary; for the rest, a good fellow and a merry,
      who will flourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, and dance a Cheshire round,
      with e'er a man in Yorkshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That last part of thy speech, Dennet,&rdquo; said the Minstrel, &ldquo;has saved thee
      a rib or twain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, man, I fear him not,&rdquo; said Dennet; &ldquo;I am somewhat old and stiff,
      but when I fought for the bell and ram at Doncaster&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the story&mdash;the story, my friend,&rdquo; again said the Minstrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the tale is but this&mdash;Athelstane of Coningsburgh was buried at
      Saint Edmund's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a lie, and a loud one,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;for I saw him borne to
      his own Castle of Coningsburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, e'en tell the story yourself, my masters,&rdquo; said Dennet,
      turning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some
      difficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of his
      comrade and the Minstrel, to renew his tale.&mdash;&ldquo;These two 'sober'
      friars,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;since this reverend man will needs have them
      such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, and what not, for the
      best part for a summer's day, when they were aroused by a deep groan, and
      a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased Athelstane entered
      the apartment, saying, 'Ye evil shep-herds!&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; said the Friar, hastily, &ldquo;he never spoke a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ho! Friar Tuck,&rdquo; said the Minstrel, drawing him apart from the
      rustics; &ldquo;we have started a new hare, I find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee, Allan-a-Dale,&rdquo; said the Hermit, &ldquo;I saw Athelstane of
      Coningsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. He had his
      shroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre&mdash;A butt of sack
      will not wash it out of my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; answered the Minstrel; &ldquo;thou dost but jest with me!&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Never believe me,&rdquo; said the Friar, &ldquo;an I fetched not a knock at him with
      my quarter-staff that would have felled an ox, and it glided through his
      body as it might through a pillar of smoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Hubert,&rdquo; said the Minstrel, &ldquo;but it is a wondrous tale, and fit
      to be put in metre to the ancient tune, 'Sorrow came to the old Friar.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh, if ye list,&rdquo; said Friar Tuck; &ldquo;but an ye catch me singing on such
      a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him headlong! No,
      no&mdash;I instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some good work,
      such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, or the like matter of
      godly service, and therefore am I here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of Saint Michael of
      Templestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet at some distance
      from the Preceptory, broke short their argument. One by one the sullen
      sounds fell successively on the ear, leaving but sufficient space for each
      to die away in distant echo, ere the air was again filled by repetition of
      the iron knell. These sounds, the signal of the approaching ceremony,
      chilled with awe the hearts of the assembled multitude, whose eyes were
      now turned to the Preceptory, expecting the approach of the Grand Master,
      the champion, and the criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing the
      great standard of the Order, sallied from the castle, preceded by six
      trumpets, and followed by the Knights Preceptors, two and two, the Grand
      Master coming last, mounted on a stately horse, whose furniture was of the
      simplest kind. Behind him came Brian de Bois-Guilbert, armed cap-a-pie in
      bright armour, but without his lance, shield, and sword, which were borne
      by his two esquires behind him. His face, though partly hidden by a long
      plume which floated down from his barrel-cap, bore a strong and mingled
      expression of passion, in which pride seemed to contend with irresolution.
      He looked ghastly pale, as if he had not slept for several nights, yet
      reined his pawing war-horse with the habitual ease and grace proper to the
      best lance of the Order of the Temple. His general appearance was grand
      and commanding; but, looking at him with attention, men read that in his
      dark features, from which they willingly withdrew their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On either side rode Conrade of Mont-Fitchet, and Albert de Malvoisin, who
      acted as godfathers to the champion. They were in their robes of peace,
      the white dress of the Order. Behind them followed other Companions of the
      Temple, with a long train of esquires and pages clad in black, aspirants
      to the honour of being one day Knights of the Order. After these neophytes
      came a guard of warders on foot, in the same sable livery, amidst whose
      partisans might be seen the pale form of the accused, moving with a slow
      but undismayed step towards the scene of her fate. She was stript of all
      her ornaments, lest perchance there should be among them some of those
      amulets which Satan was supposed to bestow upon his victims, to deprive
      them of the power of confession even when under the torture. A coarse
      white dress, of the simplest form, had been substituted for her Oriental
      garments; yet there was such an exquisite mixture of courage and
      resignation in her look, that even in this garb, and with no other
      ornament than her long black tresses, each eye wept that looked upon her,
      and the most hardened bigot regretted the fate that had converted a
      creature so goodly into a vessel of wrath, and a waged slave of the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of inferior personages belonging to the Preceptory followed the
      victim, all moving with the utmost order, with arms folded, and looks bent
      upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      This slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of which
      was the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched once around them from
      right to left, and when they had completed the circle, made a halt. There
      was then a momentary bustle, while the Grand Master and all his
      attendants, excepting the champion and his godfathers, dismounted from
      their horses, which were immediately removed out of the lists by the
      esquires, who were in attendance for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the
      pile. On her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations were
      making for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the body,
      she was observed to shudder and shut her eyes, praying internally
      doubtless, for her lips moved though no speech was heard. In the space of
      a minute she opened her eyes, looked fixedly on the pile as if to
      familiarize her mind with the object, and then slowly and naturally turned
      away her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Grand Master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry of
      his order was placed around and behind him, each in his due rank, a loud
      and long flourish of the trumpets announced that the Court were seated for
      judgment. Malvoisin, then, acting as godfather of the champion, stepped
      forward, and laid the glove of the Jewess, which was the pledge of battle,
      at the feet of the Grand Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valorous Lord, and reverend Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here standeth the good
      Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Knight Preceptor of the Order of the
      Temple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which I now lay at your
      reverence's feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this day,
      to maintain that this Jewish maiden, by name Rebecca, hath justly deserved
      the doom passed upon her in a Chapter of this most Holy Order of the
      Temple of Zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;&mdash;here, I say,
      he standeth, such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such be your
      noble and sanctified pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath he made oath,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;that his quarrel is just and
      honourable? Bring forward the Crucifix and the 'Te igitur'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, and most reverend father,&rdquo; answered Malvoisin, readily, &ldquo;our brother
      here present hath already sworn to the truth of his accusation in the hand
      of the good Knight Conrade de Mont-Fitchet; and otherwise he ought not to
      be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever, and may take no
      oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explanation was satisfactory, to Albert's great joy; for the wily
      knight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of
      prevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert to take such an oath before the
      assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his
      doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master, having allowed the apology of Albert Malvoisin,
      commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. The trumpets then
      again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;Oyez,
      oyez, oyez.&mdash;Here standeth the good Knight, Sir Brian de
      Bois-Guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who will
      sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the Jewess Rebecca, to try by
      champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to such
      champion the reverend and valorous Grand Master here present allows a fair
      field, and equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever else appertains
      to a fair combat.&rdquo; The trumpets again sounded, and there was a dead pause
      of many minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No champion appears for the appellant,&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;Go,
      herald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her in
      this her cause.&rdquo; The herald went to the chair in which Rebecca was seated,
      and Bois-Guilbert suddenly turning his horse's head toward that end of the
      lists, in spite of hints on either side from Malvoisin and Mont-Fitchet,
      was by the side of Rebecca's chair as soon as the herald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this regular, and according to the law of combat?&rdquo; said Malvoisin,
      looking to the Grand Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert de Malvoisin, it is,&rdquo; answered Beaumanoir; &ldquo;for in this appeal to
      the judgment of God, we may not prohibit parties from having that
      communication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the
      truth of the quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the herald spoke to Rebecca in these terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Damsel,
      the Honourable and Reverend the Grand Master demands of thee, if thou art
      prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if thou
      dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to the Grand Master,&rdquo; replied Rebecca, &ldquo;that I maintain my innocence,
      and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest I become guilty of mine own
      blood. Say to him, that I challenge such delay as his forms will permit,
      to see if God, whose opportunity is in man's extremity, will raise me up a
      deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed, may His holy will be
      done!&rdquo; The herald retired to carry this answer to the Grand Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said Lucas Beaumanoir, &ldquo;that Jew or Pagan should impeach us
      of injustice!&mdash;Until the shadows be cast from the west to the
      eastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this
      unfortunate woman. When the day is so far passed, let her prepare for
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The herald communicated the words of the Grand Master to Rebecca, who
      bowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards
      heaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce
      promise herself from man. During this awful pause, the voice of
      Bois-Guilbert broke upon her ear&mdash;it was but a whisper, yet it
      startled her more than the summons of the herald had appeared to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said the Templar, &ldquo;dost thou hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,&rdquo; said the unfortunate
      maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but dost thou understand my words?&rdquo; said the Templar; &ldquo;for the sound
      of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. I scarce know on what ground we
      stand, or for what purpose they have brought us hither.&mdash;This listed
      space&mdash;that chair&mdash;these faggots&mdash;I know their purpose, and
      yet it appears to me like something unreal&mdash;the fearful picture of a
      vision, which appals my sense with hideous fantasies, but convinces not my
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind and senses keep touch and time,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;and tell me
      alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly body, and open
      a painful but a brief passage to a better world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreams, Rebecca,&mdash;dreams,&rdquo; answered the Templar; &ldquo;idle visions,
      rejected by the wisdom of your own wiser Sadducees. Hear me, Rebecca,&rdquo; he
      said, proceeding with animation; &ldquo;a better chance hast thou for life and
      liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of. Mount thee behind me on my
      steed&mdash;on Zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his rider. I won
      him in single fight from the Soldan of Trebizond&mdash;mount, I say,
      behind me&mdash;in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behind&mdash;a
      new world of pleasure opens to thee&mdash;to me a new career of fame. Let
      them speak the doom which I despise, and erase the name of Bois-Guilbert
      from their list of monastic slaves! I will wash out with blood whatever
      blot they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempter,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;begone!&mdash;Not in this last extremity canst
      thou move me one hair's-breadth from my resting place&mdash;surrounded as
      I am by foes, I hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy&mdash;avoid
      thee, in the name of God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert Malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their
      conference, now advanced to interrupt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?&rdquo; he demanded of Bois-Guilbert;
      &ldquo;or is she resolute in her denial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is indeed resolute,&rdquo; said Bois-Guilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Malvoisin, &ldquo;must thou, noble brother, resume thy place to
      attend the issue&mdash;The shades are changing on the circle of the dial&mdash;Come,
      brave Bois-Guilbert&mdash;come, thou hope of our holy Order, and soon to
      be its head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke in this soothing tone, he laid his hand on the knight's
      bridle, as if to lead him back to his station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;False villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?&rdquo; said Sir Brian,
      angrily. And shaking off his companion's grasp, he rode back to the upper
      end of the lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is yet spirit in him,&rdquo; said Malvoisin apart to Mont-Fitchet, &ldquo;were
      it well directed&mdash;but, like the Greek fire, it burns whatever
      approaches it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the
      appearance of a champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And reason good,&rdquo; said Friar Tuck, &ldquo;seeing she is a Jewess&mdash;and yet,
      by mine Order, it is hard that so young and beautiful a creature should
      perish without one blow being struck in her behalf! Were she ten times a
      witch, provided she were but the least bit of a Christian, my
      quarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce Templar,
      ere he carried the matter off thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear for
      a Jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by Malvoisin,
      whispered to each other, that it was time to declare the pledge of Rebecca
      forfeited. At this instant a knight, urging his horse to speed, appeared
      on the plain advancing towards the lists. A hundred voices exclaimed, &ldquo;A
      champion! a champion!&rdquo; And despite the prepossessions and prejudices of
      the multitude, they shouted unanimously as the knight rode into the
      tiltyard. The second glance, however, served to destroy the hope that his
      timely arrival had excited. His horse, urged for many miles to its utmost
      speed, appeared to reel from fatigue, and the rider, however undauntedly
      he presented himself in the lists, either from weakness, weariness, or
      both, seemed scarce able to support himself in the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and
      purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, &ldquo;I am a good
      knight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just and
      lawful quarrel of this damsel, Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York; to
      uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and to
      defy Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and liar; as I
      will prove in this field with my body against his, by the aid of God, of
      Our Lady, and of Monseigneur Saint George, the good knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stranger must first show,&rdquo; said Malvoisin, &ldquo;that he is good knight,
      and of honourable lineage. The Temple sendeth not forth her champions
      against nameless men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said the Knight, raising his helmet, &ldquo;is better known, my
      lineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I am Wilfred of Ivanhoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fight with thee at present,&rdquo; said the Templar, in a changed
      and hollow voice. &ldquo;Get thy wounds healed, purvey thee a better horse, and
      it may be I will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this boyish
      spirit of bravado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! proud Templar,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;hast thou forgotten that twice didst
      thou fall before this lance? Remember the lists at Acre&mdash;remember the
      Passage of Arms at Ashby&mdash;remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of
      Rotherwood, and the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary, that
      thou wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the honour
      thou hadst lost! By that reliquary and the holy relic it contains, I will
      proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in every court in Europe&mdash;in every
      Preceptory of thine Order&mdash;unless thou do battle without farther
      delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards Rebecca, and
      then exclaimed, looking fiercely at Ivanhoe, &ldquo;Dog of a Saxon! take thy
      lance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the Grand Master allow me the combat?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not deny what thou hast challenged,&rdquo; said the Grand Master,
      &ldquo;provided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. Yet I would thou wert
      in better plight to do battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou ever been,
      yet would I have thee honourably met with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus&mdash;thus as I am, and not otherwise,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;it is the
      judgment of God&mdash;to his keeping I commend myself.&mdash;Rebecca,&rdquo;
       said he, riding up to the fatal chair, &ldquo;dost thou accept of me for thy
      champion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; fluttered by an emotion which the fear of
      death had been unable to produce, &ldquo;I do accept thee as the champion whom
      Heaven hath sent me. Yet, no&mdash;no&mdash;thy wounds are uncured&mdash;Meet
      not that proud man&mdash;why shouldst thou perish also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and assumed
      his lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same; and his esquire remarked, as he
      clasped his visor, that his face, which had, notwithstanding the variety
      of emotions by which he had been agitated, continued during the whole
      morning of an ashy paleness, was now become suddenly very much flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his voice,
      repeating thrice&mdash;&ldquo;Faites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!&rdquo; After the
      third cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again proclaimed,
      that none, on peril of instant death, should dare, by word, cry, or
      action, to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat. The Grand
      Master, who held in his hand the gage of battle, Rebecca's glove, now
      threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal words, &ldquo;Laissez
      aller&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full career.
      The wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less exhausted rider, went down,
      as all had expected, before the well-aimed lance and vigorous steed of the
      Templar. This issue of the combat all had foreseen; but although the spear
      of Ivanhoe did but, in comparison, touch the shield of Bois-Guilbert, that
      champion, to the astonishment of all who beheld it reeled in his saddle,
      lost his stirrups, and fell in the lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was soon on foot,
      hastening to mend his fortune with his sword; but his antagonist arose
      not. Wilfred, placing his foot on his breast, and the sword's point to his
      throat, commanded him to yield him, or die on the spot. Bois-Guilbert
      returned no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slay him not, Sir Knight,&rdquo; cried the Grand Master, &ldquo;unshriven and
      unabsolved&mdash;kill not body and soul! We allow him vanquished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm the conquered
      champion. His eyes were closed&mdash;the dark red flush was still on his
      brow. As they looked on him in astonishment, the eyes opened&mdash;but
      they were fixed and glazed. The flush passed from his brow, and gave way
      to the pallid hue of death. Unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had
      died a victim to the violence of his own contending passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is indeed the judgment of God,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, looking
      upwards&mdash;&ldquo;'Fiat voluntas tua!'&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     So! now 'tis ended, like an old wife's story.
     Webster
</pre>
    <p>
      When the first moments of surprise were over, Wilfred of Ivanhoe demanded
      of the Grand Master, as judge of the field, if he had manfully and
      rightfully done his duty in the combat? &ldquo;Manfully and rightfully hath it
      been done,&rdquo; said the Grand Master. &ldquo;I pronounce the maiden free and
      guiltless&mdash;The arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the
      will of the victor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not despoil him of his weapons,&rdquo; said the Knight of Ivanhoe, &ldquo;nor
      condemn his corpse to shame&mdash;he hath fought for Christendom&mdash;God's
      arm, no human hand, hath this day struck him down. But let his obsequies
      be private, as becomes those of a man who died in an unjust quarrel.&mdash;And
      for the maiden&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a clattering of horses' feet, advancing in such
      numbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them; and the Black
      Knight galloped into the lists. He was followed by a numerous band of
      men-at-arms, and several knights in complete armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too late,&rdquo; he said, looking around him. &ldquo;I had doomed Bois-Guilbert
      for mine own property.&mdash;Ivanhoe, was this well, to take on thee such
      a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven, my Liege,&rdquo; answered Ivanhoe, &ldquo;hath taken this proud man for its
      victim. He was not to be honoured in dying as your will had designed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace be with him,&rdquo; said Richard, looking steadfastly on the corpse, &ldquo;if
      it may be so&mdash;he was a gallant knight, and has died in his steel
      harness full knightly. But we must waste no time&mdash;Bohun, do thine
      office!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Knight stepped forward from the King's attendants, and, laying his hand
      on the shoulder of Albert de Malvoisin, said, &ldquo;I arrest thee of High
      Treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so
      many warriors.&mdash;He now spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who dares to arrest a Knight of the Temple of Zion, within the girth of
      his own Preceptory, and in the presence of the Grand Master? and by whose
      authority is this bold outrage offered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make the arrest,&rdquo; replied the Knight&mdash;&ldquo;I, Henry Bohun, Earl of
      Essex, Lord High Constable of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he arrests Malvoisin,&rdquo; said the King, raising his visor, &ldquo;by the
      order of Richard Plantagenet, here present.&mdash;Conrade Mont-Fitchet, it
      is well for thee thou art born no subject of mine.&mdash;But for thee,
      Malvoisin, thou diest with thy brother Philip, ere the world be a week
      older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will resist thy doom,&rdquo; said the Grand Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud Templar,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;thou canst not&mdash;look up, and behold
      the Royal Standard of England floats over thy towers instead of thy Temple
      banner!&mdash;Be wise, Beaumanoir, and make no bootless opposition&mdash;Thy
      hand is in the lion's mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will appeal to Rome against thee,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, &ldquo;for
      usurpation on the immunities and privileges of our Order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;but for thine own sake tax me not with usurpation
      now. Dissolve thy Chapter, and depart with thy followers to thy next
      Preceptory, (if thou canst find one), which has not been made the scene of
      treasonable conspiracy against the King of England&mdash;Or, if thou wilt,
      remain, to share our hospitality, and behold our justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be a guest in the house where I should command?&rdquo; said the Templar;
      &ldquo;never!&mdash;Chaplains, raise the Psalm, 'Quare fremuerunt Gentes?'&mdash;Knights,
      squires, and followers of the Holy Temple, prepare to follow the banner of
      'Beau-seant!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of
      England's king himself, and inspired courage into his surprised and
      dismayed followers. They gathered around him like the sheep around the
      watch-dog, when they hear the baying of the wolf. But they evinced not the
      timidity of the scared flock&mdash;there were dark brows of defiance, and
      looks which menaced the hostility they dared not to proffer in words. They
      drew together in a dark line of spears, from which the white cloaks of the
      knights were visible among the dusky garments of their retainers, like the
      lighter-coloured edges of a sable cloud. The multitude, who had raised a
      clamorous shout of reprobation, paused and gazed in silence on the
      formidable and experienced body to which they had unwarily bade defiance,
      and shrunk back from their front.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Essex, when he beheld them pause in their assembled force,
      dashed the rowels into his charger's sides, and galloped backwards and
      forwards to array his followers, in opposition to a band so formidable.
      Richard alone, as if he loved the danger his presence had provoked, rode
      slowly along the front of the Templars, calling aloud, &ldquo;What, sirs! Among
      so many gallant knights, will none dare splinter a spear with Richard?&mdash;Sirs
      of the Temple! your ladies are but sun-burned, if they are not worth the
      shiver of a broken lance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brethren of the Temple,&rdquo; said the Grand Master, riding forward in
      advance of their body, &ldquo;fight not on such idle and profane quarrel&mdash;and
      not with thee, Richard of England, shall a Templar cross lance in my
      presence. The Pope and Princes of Europe shall judge our quarrel, and
      whether a Christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which
      thou hast to-day adopted. If unassailed, we depart assailing no one. To
      thine honour we refer the armour and household goods of the Order which we
      leave behind us, and on thy conscience we lay the scandal and offence thou
      hast this day given to Christendom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, and without waiting a reply, the Grand Master gave the
      signal of departure. Their trumpets sounded a wild march, of an Oriental
      character, which formed the usual signal for the Templars to advance. They
      changed their array from a line to a column of march, and moved off as
      slowly as their horses could step, as if to show it was only the will of
      their Grand Master, and no fear of the opposing and superior force, which
      compelled them to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the splendour of Our Lady's brow!&rdquo; said King Richard, &ldquo;it is pity of
      their lives that these Templars are not so trusty as they are disciplined
      and valiant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of its
      challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as the rear of the
      squadron left the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the tumult which attended the retreat of the Templars, Rebecca saw
      and heard nothing&mdash;she was locked in the arms of her aged father,
      giddy, and almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances around
      her. But one word from Isaac at length recalled her scattered feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my dear daughter, my recovered treasure&mdash;let
      us go to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;O no&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;I must not at this
      moment dare to speak to him&mdash;Alas! I should say more than&mdash;No,
      my father, let us instantly leave this evil place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my daughter,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;to leave him who hath come forth like a
      strong man with his spear and shield, holding his life as nothing, so he
      might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a people
      strange unto him and his&mdash;this is service to be thankfully
      acknowledged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;it is&mdash;most thankfully&mdash;most devoutly
      acknowledged,&rdquo; said Rebecca&mdash;&ldquo;it shall be still more so&mdash;but not
      now&mdash;for the sake of thy beloved Rachel, father, grant my request&mdash;not
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said Isaac, insisting, &ldquo;they will deem us more thankless than
      mere dogs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thou seest, my dear father, that King Richard is in presence, and
      that&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, my best&mdash;my wisest Rebecca!&mdash;Let us hence&mdash;let us
      hence!&mdash;Money he will lack, for he has just returned from Palestine,
      and, as they say, from prison&mdash;and pretext for exacting it, should he
      need any, may arise out of my simple traffic with his brother John. Away,
      away, let us hence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists,
      and by means of conveyance which he had provided, transported her safely
      to the house of the Rabbi Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the day,
      having now retired unobserved, the attention of the populace was
      transferred to the Black Knight. They now filled the air with &ldquo;Long life
      to Richard with the Lion's Heart, and down with the usurping Templars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe to the Earl of Essex,
      &ldquo;it was well the King took the precaution to bring thee with him, noble
      Earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl smiled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gallant Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said Essex, &ldquo;dost thou know our Master so well, and yet
      suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! I was drawing towards York
      having heard that Prince John was making head there, when I met King
      Richard, like a true knight-errant, galloping hither to achieve in his own
      person this adventure of the Templar and the Jewess, with his own single
      arm. I accompanied him with my band, almost maugre his consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what news from York, brave Earl?&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;will the rebels bide
      us there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than December's snow will bide July's sun,&rdquo; said the Earl; &ldquo;they
      are dispersing; and who should come posting to bring us the news, but John
      himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The traitor! the ungrateful insolent traitor!&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;did not
      Richard order him into confinement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! he received him,&rdquo; answered the Earl, &ldquo;as if they had met after a
      hunting party; and, pointing to me and our men-at-arms, said, 'Thou seest,
      brother, I have some angry men with me&mdash;thou wert best go to our
      mother, carry her my duteous affection, and abide with her until men's
      minds are pacified.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this was all he said?&rdquo; enquired Ivanhoe; &ldquo;would not any one say that
      this Prince invites men to treason by his clemency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just,&rdquo; replied the Earl, &ldquo;as the man may be said to invite death, who
      undertakes to fight a combat, having a dangerous wound unhealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive thee the jest, Lord Earl,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe; &ldquo;but, remember, I
      hazarded but my own life&mdash;Richard, the welfare of his kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those,&rdquo; replied Essex, &ldquo;who are specially careless of their own welfare,
      are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others&mdash;But let us haste
      to the castle, for Richard meditates punishing some of the subordinate
      members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their principal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and
      which are given at length in the Wardour Manuscript, it appears that
      Maurice de Bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of Philip
      of France; while Philip de Malvoisin, and his brother Albert, the
      Preceptor of Templestowe, were executed, although Waldemar Fitzurse, the
      soul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and Prince John, for
      whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his good-natured
      brother. No one, however, pitied the fate of the two Malvoisins, who only
      suffered the death which they had both well deserved, by many acts of
      falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly after the judicial combat, Cedric the Saxon was summoned to the
      court of Richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that had
      been disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at York.
      Cedric tushed and pshawed more than once at the message&mdash;but he
      refused not obedience. In fact, the return of Richard had quenched every
      hope that he had entertained of restoring a Saxon dynasty in England; for,
      whatever head the Saxons might have made in the event of a civil war, it
      was plain that nothing could be done under the undisputed dominion of
      Richard, popular as he was by his personal good qualities and military
      fame, although his administration was wilfully careless, now too
      indulgent, and now allied to despotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, moreover, it could not escape even Cedric's reluctant observation,
      that his project for an absolute union among the Saxons, by the marriage
      of Rowena and Athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the mutual
      dissent of both parties concerned. This was, indeed, an event which, in
      his ardour for the Saxon cause, he could not have anticipated, and even
      when the disinclination of both was broadly and plainly manifested, he
      could scarce bring himself to believe that two Saxons of royal descent
      should scruple, on personal grounds, at an alliance so necessary for the
      public weal of the nation. But it was not the less certain: Rowena had
      always expressed her repugnance to Athelstane, and now Athelstane was no
      less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue his
      addresses to the Lady Rowena. Even the natural obstinacy of Cedric sunk
      beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point of junction, had
      the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with each hand. He
      made, however, a last vigorous attack on Athelstane, and he found that
      resuscitated sprout of Saxon royalty engaged, like country squires of our
      own day, in a furious war with the clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the Abbot of Saint
      Edmund's, Athelstane's spirit of revenge, what between the natural
      indolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of his
      mother Edith, attached, like most ladies, (of the period,) to the clerical
      order, had terminated in his keeping the Abbot and his monks in the
      dungeons of Coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet. For this
      atrocity the Abbot menaced him with excommunication, and made out a
      dreadful list of complaints in the bowels and stomach, suffered by himself
      and his monks, in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust imprisonment
      they had sustained. With this controversy, and with the means he had
      adopted to counteract this clerical persecution, Cedric found the mind of
      his friend Athelstane so fully occupied, that it had no room for another
      idea. And when Rowena's name was mentioned the noble Athelstane prayed
      leave to quaff a full goblet to her health, and that she might soon be the
      bride of his kinsman Wilfred. It was a desperate case therefore. There was
      obviously no more to be made of Athelstane; or, as Wamba expressed it, in
      a phrase which has descended from Saxon times to ours, he was a cock that
      would not fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained betwixt Cedric and the determination which the lovers
      desired to come to, only two obstacles&mdash;his own obstinacy, and his
      dislike of the Norman dynasty. The former feeling gradually gave way
      before the endearments of his ward, and the pride which he could not help
      nourishing in the fame of his son. Besides, he was not insensible to the
      honour of allying his own line to that of Alfred, when the superior claims
      of the descendant of Edward the Confessor were abandoned for ever.
      Cedric's aversion to the Norman race of kings was also much undermined,&mdash;first,
      by consideration of the impossibility of ridding England of the new
      dynasty, a feeling which goes far to create loyalty in the subject to the
      king &ldquo;de facto&rdquo;; and, secondly, by the personal attention of King Richard,
      who delighted in the blunt humour of Cedric, and, to use the language of
      the Wardour Manuscript, so dealt with the noble Saxon, that, ere he had
      been a guest at court for seven days, he had given his consent to the
      marriage of his ward Rowena and his son Wilfred of Ivanhoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nuptials of our hero, thus formally approved by his father, were
      celebrated in the most august of temples, the noble Minster of York. The
      King himself attended, and from the countenance which he afforded on this
      and other occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded Saxons, gave
      them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their just rights,
      than they could reasonably hope from the precarious chance of a civil war.
      The Church gave her full solemnities, graced with all the splendour which
      she of Rome knows how to apply with such brilliant effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master
      whom he had served so faithfully, and the magnanimous Wamba, decorated
      with a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. Sharers of
      Wilfred's dangers and adversity, they remained, as they had a right to
      expect, the partakers of his more prosperous career.
    </p>
    <p>
      But besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were
      celebrated by the attendance of the high-born Normans, as well as Saxons,
      joined with the universal jubilee of the lower orders, that marked the
      marriage of two individuals as a pledge of the future peace and harmony
      betwixt two races, which, since that period, have been so completely
      mingled, that the distinction has become wholly invisible. Cedric lived to
      see this union approximate towards its completion; for as the two nations
      mixed in society and formed intermarriages with each other, the Normans
      abated their scorn, and the Saxons were refined from their rusticity. But
      it was not until the reign of Edward the Third that the mixed language,
      now termed English, was spoken at the court of London, and that the
      hostile distinction of Norman and Saxon seems entirely to have
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the second morning after this happy bridal, that the Lady
      Rowena was made acquainted by her handmaid Elgitha, that a damsel desired
      admission to her presence, and solicited that their parley might be
      without witness. Rowena wondered, hesitated, became curious, and ended by
      commanding the damsel to be admitted, and her attendants to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered&mdash;a noble and commanding figure, the long white veil, in
      which she was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the elegance
      and majesty of her shape. Her demeanour was that of respect, unmingled by
      the least shade either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate favour. Rowena
      was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to the feelings, of
      others. She arose, and would have conducted her lovely visitor to a seat;
      but the stranger looked at Elgitha, and again intimated a wish to
      discourse with the Lady Rowena alone. Elgitha had no sooner retired with
      unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the Lady of Ivanhoe, her fair
      visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to her forehead, and
      bending her head to the ground, in spite of Rowena's resistance, kissed
      the embroidered hem of her tunic.

    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this, lady?&rdquo; said the surprised bride; &ldquo;or why do you offer to
      me a deference so unusual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because to you, Lady of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; said Rebecca, rising up and resuming
      the usual quiet dignity of her manner, &ldquo;I may lawfully, and without
      rebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which I owe to Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I am&mdash;forgive
      the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my country&mdash;I am
      the unhappy Jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his life against such
      fearful odds in the tiltyard of Templestowe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; said Rowena, &ldquo;Wilfred of Ivanhoe on that day rendered back but
      in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his wounds and
      misfortunes. Speak, is there aught remains in which he or I can serve
      thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Rebecca, calmly, &ldquo;unless you will transmit to him my
      grateful farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave England then?&rdquo; said Rowena, scarce recovering the surprise of
      this extraordinary visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. My father had a brother
      high in favour with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada&mdash;thither we go,
      secure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the
      Moslem exact from our people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you not then as well protected in England?&rdquo; said Rowena. &ldquo;My
      husband has favour with the King&mdash;the King himself is just and
      generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;I doubt it not&mdash;but the people of England are
      a fierce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among themselves,
      and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other. Such is no
      safe abode for the children of my people. Ephraim is an heartless dove&mdash;Issachar
      an over-laboured drudge, which stoops between two burdens. Not in a land
      of war and blood, surrounded by hostile neighbours, and distracted by
      internal factions, can Israel hope to rest during her wanderings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, maiden,&rdquo; said Rowena&mdash;&ldquo;you surely can have nothing to fear.
      She who nursed the sick-bed of Ivanhoe,&rdquo; she continued, rising with
      enthusiasm&mdash;&ldquo;she can have nothing to fear in England, where Saxon and
      Norman will contend who shall most do her honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy speech is fair, lady,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;and thy purpose fairer; but it
      may not be&mdash;there is a gulf betwixt us. Our breeding, our faith,
      alike forbid either to pass over it. Farewell&mdash;yet, ere I go indulge
      me one request. The bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign to raise it,
      and let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are scarce worthy of being looked upon,&rdquo; said Rowena; &ldquo;but,
      expecting the same from my visitant, I remove the veil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousness of beauty,
      partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, that cheek, brow, neck,
      and bosom, were suffused with crimson. Rebecca blushed also, but it was a
      momentary feeling; and, mastered by higher emotions, past slowly from her
      features like the crimson cloud, which changes colour when the sun sinks
      beneath the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the countenance you have deigned to show me will long
      dwell in my remembrance. There reigns in it gentleness and goodness; and
      if a tinge of the world's pride or vanities may mix with an expression so
      lovely, how should we chide that which is of earth for bearing some colour
      of its original? Long, long will I remember your features, and bless God
      that I leave my noble deliverer united with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short&mdash;her eyes filled with tears. She hastily wiped
      them, and answered to the anxious enquiries of Rowena&mdash;&ldquo;I am well,
      lady&mdash;well. But my heart swells when I think of Torquilstone and the
      lists of Templestowe.&mdash;Farewell. One, the most trifling part of my
      duty, remains undischarged. Accept this casket&mdash;startle not at its
      contents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet, or
      neck lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which were obviously of immense
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; she said, tendering back the casket. &ldquo;I dare not
      accept a gift of such consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet keep it, lady,&rdquo; returned Rebecca.&mdash;&ldquo;You have power, rank,
      command, influence; we have wealth, the source both of our strength and
      weakness; the value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not
      influence half so much as your slightest wish. To you, therefore, the gift
      is of little value,&mdash;and to me, what I part with is of much less. Let
      me not think you deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your commons
      believe. Think ye that I prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my
      liberty? or that my father values them in comparison to the honour of his
      only child? Accept them, lady&mdash;to me they are valueless. I will never
      wear jewels more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are then unhappy!&rdquo; said Rowena, struck with the manner in which
      Rebecca uttered the last words. &ldquo;O, remain with us&mdash;the counsel of
      holy men will wean you from your erring law, and I will be a sister to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, lady,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in her
      soft voice and beautiful features&mdash;&ldquo;that&mdash;may not be. I may not
      change the faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in
      which I seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, I will not be. He, to whom I
      dedicate my future life, will be my comforter, if I do His will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?&rdquo; asked
      Rowena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, lady,&rdquo; said the Jewess; &ldquo;but among our people, since the time of
      Abraham downwards, have been women who have devoted their thoughts to
      Heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the sick,
      feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. Among these will Rebecca
      be numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he chance to enquire after the
      fate of her whose life he saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an involuntary tremour on Rebecca's voice, and a tenderness of
      accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have
      expressed. She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;May He, who made both Jew and Christian, shower
      down on you his choicest blessings! The bark that waits us hence will be
      under weigh ere we can reach the port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glided from the apartment, leaving Rowena surprised as if a vision had
      passed before her. The fair Saxon related the singular conference to her
      husband, on whose mind it made a deep impression. He lived long and
      happily with Rowena, for they were attached to each other by the bonds of
      early affection, and they loved each other the more, from the recollection
      of the obstacles which had impeded their union. Yet it would be enquiring
      too curiously to ask, whether the recollection of Rebecca's beauty and
      magnanimity did not recur to his mind more frequently than the fair
      descendant of Alfred might altogether have approved.

      Ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of Richard, and was graced
      with farther marks of the royal favour. He might have risen still higher,
      but for the premature death of the heroic Coeur-de-Lion, before the Castle

      romantic monarch, perished all the projects which his ambition and his

      the lines composed by Johnson for Charles of Sweden&mdash;

      Note A.&mdash;The Ranger or the Forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our
      dogs.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A most sensible grievance of those aggrieved times were the Forest Laws.
      These oppressive enactments were the produce of the Norman Conquest, for
      the Saxon laws of the chase were mild and humane; while those of William,
      enthusiastically attached to the exercise and its rights, were to the last
      degree tyrannical. The formation of the New Forest, bears evidence to his
      passion for hunting, where he reduced many a happy village to the
      condition of that one commemorated by my friend, Mr William Stewart Rose:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Amongst the ruins of the church
     The midnight raven found a perch,
     A melancholy place;
     The ruthless Conqueror cast down,
     Woe worth the deed, that little town,
     To lengthen out his chase.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The disabling dogs, which might be necessary for keeping flocks and herds,
      from running at the deer, was called &ldquo;lawing&rdquo;, and was in general use. The
      Charter of the Forest designed to lessen those evils, declares that
      inquisition, or view, for lawing dogs, shall be made every third year, and
      shall be then done by the view and testimony of lawful men, not otherwise;
      and they whose dogs shall be then found unlawed, shall give three
      shillings for mercy, and for the future no man's ox shall be taken for
      lawing. Such lawing also shall be done by the assize commonly used, and
      which is, that three claws shall be cut off without the ball of the right
      foot. See on this subject the Historical Essay on the Magna Charta of King
      John, (a most beautiful volume), by Richard Thomson.

    <h3>
      Note B.&mdash;Negro Slaves.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The severe accuracy of some critics has objected to the complexion of the
      slaves of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as being totally out of costume and
      propriety. I remember the same objection being made to a set of sable
      functionaries, whom my friend, Mat Lewis, introduced as the guards and
      mischief-doing satellites of the wicked Baron, in his Castle Spectre. Mat
      treated the objection with great contempt, and averred in reply, that he
      made the slaves black in order to obtain a striking effect of contrast,
      and that, could he have derived a similar advantage from making his
      heroine blue, blue she should have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not pretend to plead the immunities of my order so highly as this;
      but neither will I allow that the author of a modern antique romance is
      obliged to confine himself to the introduction of those manners only which
      can be proved to have absolutely existed in the times he is depicting, so
      that he restrain himself to such as are plausible and natural, and contain
      no obvious anachronism. In this point of view, what can be more natural,
      than that the Templars, who, we know, copied closely the luxuries of the
      Asiatic warriors with whom they fought, should use the service of the
      enslaved Africans, whom the fate of war transferred to new masters? I am
      sure, if there are no precise proofs of their having done so, there is
      nothing, on the other hand, that can entitle us positively to conclude
      that they never did. Besides, there is an instance in romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      John of Rampayne, an excellent juggler and minstrel, undertook to effect
      the escape of one Audulf de Bracy, by presenting himself in disguise at
      the court of the king, where he was confined. For this purpose, &ldquo;he
      stained his hair and his whole body entirely as black as jet, so that
      nothing was white but his teeth,&rdquo; and succeeded in imposing himself on the
      king, as an Ethiopian minstrel. He effected, by stratagem, the escape of
      the prisoner. Negroes, therefore, must have been known in England in the
      dark ages. <a href="#linknote-60" name="linknoteref-60" id="linknoteref-60"><small>60</small></a>

    </h3>
    <p>
      The realm of France, it is well known, was divided betwixt the Norman and
      Teutonic race, who spoke the language in which the word Yes is pronounced
      as &ldquo;oui&rdquo;, and the inhabitants of the southern regions, whose speech
      bearing some affinity to the Italian, pronounced the same word &ldquo;oc&rdquo;. The
      poets of the former race were called &ldquo;Minstrels&rdquo;, and their poems &ldquo;Lays&rdquo;:
      those of the latter were termed &ldquo;Troubadours&rdquo;, and their compositions
      called &ldquo;sirventes&rdquo;, and other names. Richard, a professed admirer of the
      joyous science in all its branches, could imitate either the minstrel or
      troubadour. It is less likely that he should have been able to compose or
      sing an English ballad; yet so much do we wish to assimilate Him of the
      Lion Heart to the band of warriors whom he led, that the anachronism, if
      there be one may readily be forgiven.

    <h3>
      Note D.&mdash;Battle of Stamford.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A great topographical blunder occurred here in former editions. The bloody
      battle alluded to in the text, fought and won by King Harold, over his
      brother the rebellious Tosti, and an auxiliary force of Danes or Norsemen,
      was said, in the text, and a corresponding note, to have taken place at
      Stamford, in Leicestershire, and upon the river Welland. This is a
      mistake, into which the author has been led by trusting to his memory, and
      so confounding two places of the same name. The Stamford, Strangford, or
      Staneford, at which the battle really was fought, is a ford upon the river
      Derwent, at the distance of about seven miles from York, and situated in
      that large and opulent county. A long wooden bridge over the Derwent, the
      site of which, with one remaining buttress, is still shown to the curious
      traveller, was furiously contested. One Norwegian long defended it by his
      single arm, and was at length pierced with a spear thrust through the
      planks of the bridge from a boat beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbourhood of Stamford, on the Derwent, contains some memorials of
      the battle. Horseshoes, swords, and the heads of halberds, or bills, are
      often found there; one place is called the &ldquo;Danes' well,&rdquo; another the
      &ldquo;Battle flats.&rdquo; From a tradition that the weapon with which the Norwegian
      champion was slain, resembled a pear, or, as others say, that the trough
      or boat in which the soldier floated under the bridge to strike the blow,
      had such a shape, the country people usually begin a great market, which
      is held at Stamford, with an entertainment called the Pear-pie feast,
      which after all may be a corruption of the Spear-pie feast. For more
      particulars, Drake's History of York may be referred to. The author's
      mistake was pointed out to him, in the most obliging manner, by Robert
      Belt, Esq. of Bossal House. The battle was fought in 1066.

    <h3>
      Note E.&mdash;The range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This horrid species of torture may remind the reader of that to which the
      Spaniards subjected Guatimozin, in order to extort a discovery of his
      concealed wealth. But, in fact, an instance of similar barbarity is to be
      found nearer home, and occurs in the annals of Queen Mary's time,
      containing so many other examples of atrocity. Every reader must
      recollect, that after the fall of the Catholic Church, and the
      Presbyterian Church Government had been established by law, the rank, and
      especially the wealth, of the Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and so forth, were
      no longer vested in ecclesiastics, but in lay impropriators of the church
      revenues, or, as the Scottish lawyers called them, titulars of the
      temporalities of the benefice, though having no claim to the spiritual
      character of their predecessors in office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these laymen, who were thus invested with ecclesiastical revenues, some
      were men of high birth and rank, like the famous Lord James Stewart, the
      Prior of St Andrews, who did not fail to keep for their own use the rents,
      lands, and revenues of the church. But if, on the other hand, the titulars
      were men of inferior importance, who had been inducted into the office by
      the interest of some powerful person, it was generally understood that the
      new Abbot should grant for his patron's benefit such leases and
      conveyances of the church lands and tithes as might afford their protector
      the lion's share of the booty. This was the origin of those who were
      wittily termed Tulchan <a href="#linknote-61" name="linknoteref-61"       id="linknoteref-61"><small>61</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishops, being a sort of imaginary prelate, whose image was set up to
      enable his patron and principal to plunder the benefice under his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other cases, however, in which men who had got grants of these
      secularised benefices, were desirous of retaining them for their own use,
      without having the influence sufficient to establish their purpose; and
      these became frequently unable to protect themselves, however unwilling to
      submit to the exactions of the feudal tyrant of the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bannatyne, secretary to John Knox, recounts a singular course of
      oppression practised on one of those titulars abbots, by the Earl of
      Cassilis in Ayrshire, whose extent of feudal influence was so wide that he
      was usually termed the King of Carrick. We give the fact as it occurs in
      Bannatyne's Journal, only premising that the Journalist held his master's
      opinions, both with respect to the Earl of Cassilis as an opposer of the
      king's party, and as being a detester of the practice of granting church
      revenues to titulars, instead of their being devoted to pious uses, such
      as the support of the clergy, expense of schools, and the relief of the
      national poor. He mingles in the narrative, therefore, a well deserved
      feeling of execration against the tyrant who employed the torture, which a
      tone of ridicule towards the patient, as if, after all, it had not been
      ill bestowed on such an equivocal and amphibious character as a titular
      abbot. He entitles his narrative,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE EARL OF CASSILIS' TYRANNY AGAINST A QUICK (i.e. LIVING) MAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Allan Stewart, friend to Captain James Stewart of Cardonall, by
      means of the Queen's corrupted court, obtained the Abbey of Crossraguel.
      The said Earl thinking himself greater than any king in those quarters,
      determined to have that whole benefice (as he hath divers others) to pay
      at his pleasure; and because he could not find sic security as his
      insatiable appetite required, this shift was devised. The said Mr Allan
      being in company with the Laird of Bargany, (also a Kennedy,) was, by the
      Earl and his friends, enticed to leave the safeguard which he had with the
      Laird, and come to make good cheer with the said Earl. The simplicity of
      the imprudent man was suddenly abused; and so he passed his time with them
      certain days, which he did in Maybole with Thomas Kennedie, uncle to the
      said Earl; after which the said Mr Allan passed, with quiet company, to
      visit the place and bounds of Crossraguel, [his abbacy,] of which the said
      Earl being surely advertised, determined to put in practice the tyranny
      which long before he had conceived. And so, as king of the country,
      apprehended the said Mr Allan, and carried him to the house of Denure,
      where for a season he was honourably treated, (if a prisoner can think any
      entertainment pleasing;) but after that certain days were spent, and that
      the Earl could not obtain the feus of Crossraguel according to his own
      appetite, he determined to prove if a collation could work that which
      neither dinner nor supper could do for a long time. And so the said Mr
      Allan was carried to a secret chamber: with him passed the honourable
      Earl, his worshipful brother, and such as were appointed to be servants at
      that banquet. In the chamber there was a grit iron chimlay, under it a
      fire; other grit provision was not seen. The first course was,&mdash;'My
      Lord Abbot,' (said the Earl,) 'it will please you confess here, that with
      your own consent you remain in my company, because ye durst not commit
      yourself to the hands of others.' The Abbot answered, 'Would you, my lord,
      that I should make a manifest lie for your pleasure? The truth is, my
      lord, it is against my will that I am here; neither yet have I any
      pleasure in your company.' 'But ye shall remain with me, nevertheless, at
      this time,' said the Earl. 'I am not able to resist your will and
      pleasure,' said the Abbot, 'in this place.' 'Ye must then obey me,' said
      the Earl,&mdash;and with that were presented unto him certain letters to
      subscribe, amongst which there was a five years' tack, and a nineteen
      years' tack, and a charter of feu of all the lands (of Crossraguel), with
      all the clauses necessary for the Earl to haste him to hell. For if
      adultery, sacrilege, oppression, barbarous cruelty, and theft heaped upon
      theft, deserve hell, the great King of Carrick can no more escape hell for
      ever, than the imprudent Abbot escaped the fire for a season as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that the Earl spied repugnance, and saw that he could not come to
      his purpose by fair means, he commanded his cooks to prepare the banquet:
      and so first they flayed the sheep, that is, they took off the Abbot's
      cloathes even to his skin, and next they bound him to the chimney&mdash;his
      legs to the one end, and his arms to the other; and so they began to beet
      [i.e. feed] the fire sometimes to his buttocks, sometimes to his legs,
      sometimes to his shoulders and arms; and that the roast might not burn,
      but that it might rest in soppe, they spared not flambing with oil,
      (basting as a cook bastes roasted meat); Lord, look thou to sic cruelty!
      And that the crying of the miserable man should not be heard, they dosed
      his mouth that the voice might be stopped. It may be suspected that some
      partisan of the King's [Darnley's] murder was there. In that torment they
      held the poor man, till that often he cried for God's sake to dispatch
      him; for he had as meikle gold in his awin purse as would buy powder
      enough to shorten his pain. The famous King of Carrick and his cooks
      perceiving the roast to be aneuch, commanded it to be tane fra the fire,
      and the Earl himself began the grace in this manner:&mdash;'Benedicite,
      Jesus Maria, you are the most obstinate man that ever I saw; gif I had
      known that ye had been so stubborn, I would not for a thousand crowns have
      handled you so; I never did so to man before you.' And yet he returned to
      the same practice within two days, and ceased not till that he obtained
      his formost purpose, that is, that he had got all his pieces subscryvit
      alsweill as ane half-roasted hand could do it. The Earl thinking himself
      sure enough so long as he had the half-roasted Abbot in his own keeping,
      and yet being ashamed of his presence by reason of his former cruelty,
      left the place of Denure in the hands of certain of his servants, and the
      half-roasted Abbot to be kept there as prisoner. The Laird of Bargany, out
      of whose company the said Abbot had been enticed, understanding, (not the
      extremity,) but the retaining of the man, sent to the court, and raised
      letters of deliverance of the person of the man according to the order,
      which being disobeyed, the said Earl for his contempt was denounced rebel,
      and put to the horne. But yet hope was there none, neither to the
      afflicted to be delivered, neither yet to the purchaser [i.e. procurer] of
      the letters to obtain any comfort thereby; for in that time God was
      despised, and the lawful authority was contemned in Scotland, in hope of
      the sudden return and regiment of that cruel murderer of her awin husband,
      of whose lords the said Earl was called one; and yet, oftener than once,
      he was solemnly sworn to the King and to his Regent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Journalist then recites the complaint of the injured Allan Stewart,
      Commendator of Crossraguel, to the Regent and Privy Council, averring his
      having been carried, partly by flattery, partly by force, to the black
      vault of Denure, a strong fortalice, built on a rock overhanging the Irish
      channel, where to execute leases and conveyances of the whole churches and
      parsonages belonging to the Abbey of Crossraguel, which he utterly refused
      as an unreasonable demand, and the more so that he had already conveyed
      them to John Stewart of Cardonah, by whose interest he had been made
      Commendator. The complainant proceeds to state, that he was, after many
      menaces, stript, bound, and his limbs exposed to fire in the manner
      already described, till, compelled by excess of agony, he subscribed the
      charter and leases presented to him, of the contents of which he was
      totally ignorant. A few days afterwards, being again required to execute a
      ratification of these deeds before a notary and witnesses, and refusing to
      do so, he was once more subjected to the same torture, until his agony was
      so excessive that he exclaimed, &ldquo;Fye on you, why do you not strike your
      whingers into me, or blow me up with a barrel of powder, rather than
      torture me thus unmercifully?&rdquo; upon which the Earl commanded Alexander
      Richard, one of his attendants, to stop the patient's mouth with a napkin,
      which was done accordingly. Thus he was once more compelled to submit to
      their tyranny. The petition concluded with stating, that the Earl, under
      pretence of the deeds thus iniquitously obtained, had taken possession of
      the whole place and living of Crossraguel, and enjoyed the profits thereof
      for three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doom of the Regent and Council shows singularly the total interruption
      of justice at this calamitous period, even in the most clamant cases of
      oppression. The Council declined interference with the course of the
      ordinary justice of the county, (which was completely under the said Earl
      of Cassilis' control,) and only enacted, that he should forbear
      molestation of the unfortunate Comendator, under the surety of two
      thousand pounds Scots. The Earl was appointed also to keep the peace
      towards the celebrated George Buchanan, who had a pension out of the same
      Abbacy, to a similar extent, and under the like penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences are thus described by the Journalist already quoted.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The said Laird of Bargany perceiving that the ordiner justice could
      neither help the oppressed, nor yet the afflicted, applied his mind to the
      next remedy, and in the end, by his servants, took the house of Denure,
      where the poor Abbot was kept prisoner. The bruit flew fra Carrick to
      Galloway, and so suddenly assembled herd and hyre-man that pertained to
      the band of the Kennedies; and so within a few hours was the house of
      Denure environed again. The master of Cassilis was the frackast [i.e. the
      readiest or boldest] and would not stay, but in his heat would lay fire to
      the dungeon, with no small boasting that all enemies within the house
      should die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was required and admonished by those that were within to be more
      moderate, and not to hazard himself so foolishly. But no admonition would
      help, till that the wind of an hacquebute blasted his shoulder, and then
      ceased he from further pursuit in fury. The Laird of Bargany had before
      purchest [obtained] of the authorities, letters, charging all faithfull
      subjects to the King's Majesty, to assist him against that cruel tyrant
      and mansworn traitor, the Earl of Cassilis; which letters, with his
      private writings, he published, and shortly found sic concurrence of Kyle
      and Cunynghame with his other friends, that the Carrick company drew back
      fra the house: and so the other approached, furnished the house with more
      men, delivered the said Mr Allan, and carried him to Ayr, where, publicly
      at the market cross of the said town, he declared how cruelly he was
      entreated, and how the murdered King suffered not sic torment as he did,
      excepting only he escaped the death: and, therefore, publickly did revoke
      all things that were done in that extremity, and especially revoked the
      subscription of the three writings, to wit, of a fyve yeir tack and
      nineteen year tack, and of a charter of feu. And so the house remained,
      and remains (till this day, the 7th of February, 1571,) in the custody of
      the said Laird of Bargany and of his servants. And so cruelty was
      disappointed of proffeit present, and shall be eternallie punished, unless
      he earnestly repent. And this far for the cruelty committed, to give
      occasion unto others, and to such as hate the monstrous dealing of
      degenerate nobility, to look more diligently upon their behaviuours, and
      to paint them forth unto the world, that they themselves may be ashamed of
      their own beastliness, and that the world may be advertised and admonished
      to abhor, detest, and avoid the company of all sic tyrants, who are not
      worthy of the society of men, but ought to be sent suddenly to the devil,
      with whom they must burn without end, for their contempt of God, and
      cruelty committed against his creatures. Let Cassilis and his brother be
      the first to be the example unto others. Amen. Amen.&rdquo; <a

    <p>
      This extract has been somewhat amended or modernized in orthography, to
      render it more intelligible to the general reader. I have to add, that the
      Kennedies of Bargany, who interfered in behalf of the oppressed Abbot,
      were themselves a younger branch of the Cassilis family, but held
      different politics, and were powerful enough in this, and other instances,
      to bid them defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate issue of this affair does not appear; but as the house of
      Cassilis are still in possession of the greater part of the feus and
      leases which belonged to Crossraguel Abbey, it is probable the talons of
      the King of Carrick were strong enough, in those disorderly times, to
      retain the prey which they had so mercilessly fixed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may also add, that it appears by some papers in my possession, that the
      officers or Country Keepers on the border, were accustomed to torment
      their prisoners by binding them to the iron bars of their chimneys, to
      extort confession.

    <h3>
      Note F.&mdash;Heraldry
    </h3>
    <p>
      The author has been here upbraided with false heraldry, as having charged
      metal upon metal. It should be remembered, however, that heraldry had only
      its first rude origin during the crusades, and that all the minutiae of
      its fantastic science were the work of time, and introduced at a much
      later period. Those who think otherwise must suppose that the Goddess of
      &ldquo;Armoirers&rdquo;, like the Goddess of Arms, sprung into the world completely
      equipped in all the gaudy trappings of the department she presides over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional Note
    </p>
    <p>
      In corroboration of said note, it may be observed, that the arms, which
      were assumed by Godfrey of Boulogne himself, after the conquest of
      Jerusalem, was a cross counter patent cantoned with four little crosses
      or, upon a field azure, displaying thus metal upon metal. The heralds have
      tried to explain this undeniable fact in different modes&mdash;but Ferne
      gallantly contends, that a prince of Godfrey's qualities should not be
      bound by the ordinary rules. The Scottish Nisbet, and the same Ferne,
      insist that the chiefs of the Crusade must have assigned to Godfrey this
      extraordinary and unwonted coat-of-arms, in order to induce those who
      should behold them to make enquiries; and hence give them the name of
      &ldquo;arma inquirenda&rdquo;. But with reverence to these grave authorities, it seems
      unlikely that the assembled princes of Europe should have adjudged to
      Godfrey a coat armorial so much contrary to the general rule, if such rule
      had then existed; at any rate, it proves that metal upon metal, now
      accounted a solecism in heraldry, was admitted in other cases similar to
      that in the text. See Ferne's &ldquo;Blazon of Gentrie&rdquo; p. 238. Edition 1586.
      Nisbet's &ldquo;Heraldry&rdquo;, vol. i. p. 113. Second Edition.

      It will readily occur to the antiquary, that these verses are intended to

    <p>
      The poetry of the Anglo-Saxons, after their civilisation and conversion,
      was of a different and softer character; but in the circumstances of
      Ulrica, she may be not unnaturally supposed to return to the wild strains
      which animated her forefathers during the time of Paganism and untamed
      ferocity.

      return from thence, it is recorded how he exchanged a pugilistic favour of
      this nature, while a prisoner in Germany. His opponent was the son of his
      principal warder, and was so imprudent as to give the challenge to this
      barter of buffets. The King stood forth like a true man, and received a
      blow which staggered him. In requital, having previously waxed his hand, a
      practice unknown, I believe, to the gentlemen of the modern fancy, he
      returned the box on the ear with such interest as to kill his antagonist
      on the spot.&mdash;See, in Ellis's Specimens of English Romance, that of

    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      It is curious to observe, that in every state of society, some sort of
      ghostly consolation is provided for the members of the community, though
      assembled for purposes diametrically opposite to religion. A gang of
      beggars have their Patrico, and the banditti of the Apennines have among
      them persons acting as monks and priests, by whom they are confessed, and
      who perform mass before them. Unquestionably, such reverend persons, in
      such a society, must accommodate their manners and their morals to the
      community in which they live; and if they can occasionally obtain a degree
      of reverence for their supposed spiritual gifts, are, on most occasions,
      loaded with unmerciful ridicule, as possessing a character inconsistent
      with all around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the fighting parson in the old play of Sir John Oldcastle, and the
      famous friar of Robin Hood's band. Nor were such characters ideal. There
      exists a monition of the Bishop of Durham against irregular churchmen of
      this class, who associated themselves with Border robbers, and desecrated
      the holiest offices of the priestly function, by celebrating them for the
      benefit of thieves, robbers, and murderers, amongst ruins and in caverns
      of the earth, without regard to canonical form, and with torn and dirty
      attire, and maimed rites, altogether improper for the occasion.

    <h3>
      Note J.&mdash;Castle of Coningsburgh.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When I last saw this interesting ruin of ancient days, one of the very few
      remaining examples of Saxon fortification, I was strongly impressed with
      the desire of tracing out a sort of theory on the subject, which, from
      some recent acquaintance with the architecture of the ancient
      Scandinavians, seemed to me peculiarly interesting. I was, however,
      obliged by circumstances to proceed on my journey, without leisure to take
      more than a transient view of Coningsburgh. Yet the idea dwells so
      strongly in my mind, that I feel considerably tempted to write a page or
      two in detailing at least the outline of my hypothesis, leaving better
      antiquaries to correct or refute conclusions which are perhaps too hastily
      drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have visited the Zetland Islands, are familiar with the
      description of castles called by the inhabitants Burghs; and by the
      Highlanders&mdash;for they are also to be found both in the Western Isles
      and on the mainland&mdash;Duns. Pennant has engraved a view of the famous
      Dun-Dornadilla in Glenelg; and there are many others, all of them built
      after a peculiar mode of architecture, which argues a people in the most
      primitive state of society. The most perfect specimen is that upon the
      island of Mousa, near to the mainland of Zetland, which is probably in the
      same state as when inhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a single round tower, the wall curving in slightly, and then turning
      outward again in the form of a dice-box, so that the defenders on the top
      might the better protect the base. It is formed of rough stones, selected
      with care, and laid in courses or circles, with much compactness, but
      without cement of any kind. The tower has never, to appearance, had
      roofing of any sort; a fire was made in the centre of the space which it
      encloses, and originally the building was probably little more than a wall
      drawn as a sort of screen around the great council fire of the tribe. But,
      although the means or ingenuity of the builders did not extend so far as
      to provide a roof, they supplied the want by constructing apartments in
      the interior of the walls of the tower itself. The circumvallation formed
      a double enclosure, the inner side of which was, in fact, two feet or
      three feet distant from the other, and connected by a concentric range of
      long flat stones, thus forming a series of concentric rings or stories of
      various heights, rising to the top of the tower. Each of these stories or
      galleries has four windows, facing directly to the points of the compass,
      and rising of course regularly above each other. These four perpendicular
      ranges of windows admitted air, and, the fire being kindled, heat, or
      smoke at least, to each of the galleries. The access from gallery to
      gallery is equally primitive. A path, on the principle of an inclined
      plane, turns round and round the building like a screw, and gives access
      to the different stories, intersecting each of them in its turn, and thus
      gradually rising to the top of the wall of the tower. On the outside there
      are no windows; and I may add, that an enclosure of a square, or sometimes
      a round form, gave the inhabitants of the Burgh an opportunity to secure
      any sheep or cattle which they might possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the general architecture of that very early period when the
      Northmen swept the seas, and brought to their rude houses, such as I have
      described them, the plunder of polished nations. In Zetland there are
      several scores of these Burghs, occupying in every case, capes, headlands,
      islets, and similar places of advantage singularly well chosen. I remember
      the remains of one upon an island in a small lake near Lerwick, which at
      high tide communicates with the sea, the access to which is very
      ingenious, by means of a causeway or dike, about three or four inches
      under the surface of the water. This causeway makes a sharp angle in its
      approach to the Burgh. The inhabitants, doubtless, were well acquainted
      with this, but strangers, who might approach in a hostile manner, and were
      ignorant of the curve of the causeway, would probably plunge into the
      lake, which is six or seven feet in depth at the least. This must have
      been the device of some Vauban or Cohorn of those early times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style of these buildings evinces that the architect possessed neither
      the art of using lime or cement of any kind, nor the skill to throw an
      arch, construct a roof, or erect a stair; and yet, with all this
      ignorance, showed great ingenuity in selecting the situation of Burghs,
      and regulating the access to them, as well as neatness and regularity in
      the erection, since the buildings themselves show a style of advance in
      the arts scarcely consistent with the ignorance of so many of the
      principal branches of architectural knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always thought, that one of the most curious and valuable objects
      of antiquaries has been to trace the progress of society, by the efforts
      made in early ages to improve the rudeness of their first expedients,
      until they either approach excellence, or, as is more frequently the case,
      are supplied by new and fundamental discoveries, which supersede both the
      earlier and ruder system, and the improvements which have been ingrafted
      upon it. For example, if we conceive the recent discovery of gas to be so
      much improved and adapted to domestic use, as to supersede all other modes
      of producing domestic light; we can already suppose, some centuries
      afterwards, the heads of a whole Society of Antiquaries half turned by the
      discovery of a pair of patent snuffers, and by the learned theories which
      would be brought forward to account for the form and purpose of so
      singular an implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following some such principle, I am inclined to regard the singular Castle
      of Coningsburgh&mdash;I mean the Saxon part of it&mdash;as a step in
      advance from the rude architecture, if it deserves the name, which must
      have been common to the Saxons as to other Northmen. The builders had
      attained the art of using cement, and of roofing a building,&mdash;great
      improvements on the original Burgh. But in the round keep, a shape only
      seen in the most ancient castles&mdash;the chambers excavated in the
      thickness of the walls and buttresses&mdash;the difficulty by which access
      is gained from one story to those above it, Coningsburgh still retains the
      simplicity of its origin, and shows by what slow degrees man proceeded
      from occupying such rude and inconvenient lodgings, as were afforded by
      the galleries of the Castle of Mousa, to the more splendid accommodations
      of the Norman castles, with all their stern and Gothic graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am ignorant if these remarks are new, or if they will be confirmed by
      closer examination; but I think, that, on a hasty observation,
      Coningsburgh offers means of curious study to those who may wish to trace
      the history of architecture back to the times preceding the Norman
      Conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be highly desirable that a cork model should be taken of the
      Castle of Mousa, as it cannot be well understood by a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Castle of Coningsburgh is thus described:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The castle is large, the outer walls standing on a pleasant ascent from
      the river, but much overtopt by a high hill, on which the town stands,
      situated at the head of a rich and magnificent vale, formed by an
      amphitheatre of woody hills, in which flows the gentle Don. Near the
      castle is a barrow, said to be Hengist's tomb. The entrance is flanked to
      the left by a round tower, with a sloping base, and there are several
      similar in the outer wall the entrance has piers of a gate, and on the
      east side the ditch and bank are double and very steep. On the top of the
      churchyard wall is a tombstone, on which are cut in high relief, two
      ravens, or such-like birds. On the south side of the churchyard lies an
      ancient stone, ridged like a coffin, on which is carved a man on
      horseback; and another man with a shield encountering a vast winged
      serpent, and a man bearing a shield behind him. It was probably one of the
      rude crosses not uncommon in churchyards in this county. See it engraved
      on the plate of crosses for this volume, plate 14. fig. 1. The name of
      Coningsburgh, by which this castle goes in the old editions of the
      Britannia, would lead one to suppose it the residence of the Saxon kings.
      It afterwards belonged to King Harold. The Conqueror bestowed it on
      William de Warren, with all its privileges and jurisdiction, which are
      said to have extended over twenty-eight towns. At the corner of the area,
      which is of an irregular form, stands the great tower, or keep, placed on
      a small hill of its own dimensions, on which lies six vast projecting
      buttresses, ascending in a steep direction to prop and support the
      building, and continued upwards up the side as turrets. The tower within
      forms a complete circle, twenty-one feet in diameter, the walls fourteen
      feet thick. The ascent into the tower is by an exceeding deep flight of
      steep steps, four feet and a half wide, on the south side leading to a low
      doorway, over which is a circular arch crossed by a great transom stone.
      Within this door is the staircase which ascends straight through the
      thickness of the wall, not communicating with the room on the first floor,
      in whose centre is the opening to the dungeon. Neither of these lower
      rooms is lighted except from a hole in the floor of the third story; the
      room in which, as well as in that above it, is finished with compact
      smooth stonework, both having chimney-pieces, with an arch resting on
      triple clustered pillars. In the third story, or guard-chamber, is a small
      recess with a loop-hole, probably a bedchamber, and in that floor above a
      niche for a saint or holy-water pot. Mr. King imagines this a Saxon castle
      of the first ages of the Heptarchy. Mr. Watson thus describes it. From the
      first floor to the second story, (third from the ground,) is a way by a
      stair in the wall five feet wide. The next staircase is approached by a
      ladder, and ends at the fourth story from the ground. Two yards from the
      door, at the head of this stair, is an opening nearly east, accessible by
      treading on the ledge of the wall, which diminishes eight inches each
      story; and this last opening leads into a room or chapel ten feet by
      twelve, and fifteen or sixteen high, arched with free-stone, and supported
      by small circular columns of the same, the capitals and arches Saxon. It
      has an east window, and on each side in the wall, about four feet from the
      ground, a stone basin with a hole and iron pipe to convey the water into
      or through the wall. This chapel is one of the buttresses, but no sign of
      it without, for even the window, though large within, is only a long
      narrow loop-hole, scarcely to be seen without. On the left side of this
      chapel is a small oratory, eight by six in the thickness of the wall, with
      a niche in the wall, and enlightened by a like loop-hole. The fourth stair
      from the ground, ten feet west from the chapel door, leads to the top of
      the tower through the thickness of the wall, which at top is but three
      yards. Each story is about fifteen feet high, so that the tower will be
      seventy-five feet from the ground. The inside forms a circle, whose
      diameter may be about twelve feet. The well at the bottom of the dungeon
      is piled with stones.&rdquo;&mdash;Gough's &ldquo;Edition Of Camden's Britannia&rdquo;.

Produced by John P. Roberts, Jr. and David Widger

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
