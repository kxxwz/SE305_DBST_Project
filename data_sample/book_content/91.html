      CHAPTER I. TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES
    </h2>
    <p>
      DO you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures? I mean
      the adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the darky Jim
      free and Tom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn&rsquo;t. It only just p&rsquo;isoned him
      for more. That was all the effect it had. You see, when we three came back
      up the river in glory, as you may say, from that long travel, and the
      village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches, and
      everybody hurrah&rsquo;d and shouted, it made us heroes, and that was what Tom
      Sawyer had always been hankering to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while he WAS satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and he tilted up
      his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it. Some called
      him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit to bust. You
      see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we only went down the
      river on a raft and came back by the steamboat, but Tom went by the
      steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and Jim a good deal, but land!
      they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I don&rsquo;t know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn&rsquo;t been
      for old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and slim, and
      kind o&rsquo; good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account of his age,
      and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. For as much as thirty years
      he&rsquo;d been the only man in the village that had a reputation&mdash;I mean a
      reputation for being a traveler, and of course he was mortal proud of it,
      and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he had told
      about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every time. And now
      comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and sets everybody admiring and
      gawking over HIS travels, and it just give the poor old man the high
      strikes. It made him sick to listen to Tom, and to hear the people say &ldquo;My
      land!&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you ever!&rdquo; &ldquo;My goodness sakes alive!&rdquo; and all such things; but
      he couldn&rsquo;t pull away from it, any more than a fly that&rsquo;s got its hind leg
      fast in the molasses. And always when Tom come to a rest, the poor old
      cretur would chip in on HIS same old travels and work them for all they
      were worth; but they were pretty faded, and didn&rsquo;t go for much, and it was
      pitiful to see. And then Tom would take another innings, and then the old
      man again&mdash;and so on, and so on, for an hour and more, each trying to
      beat out the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, Parsons&rsquo; travels happened like this: When he first got to be
      postmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for somebody
      he didn&rsquo;t know, and there wasn&rsquo;t any such person in the village. Well, he
      didn&rsquo;t know what to do, nor how to act, and there the letter stayed and
      stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of it gave him a
      conniption. The postage wasn&rsquo;t paid on it, and that was another thing to
      worry about. There wasn&rsquo;t any way to collect that ten cents, and he
      reckon&rsquo;d the gov&rsquo;ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turn him
      out besides, when they found he hadn&rsquo;t collected it. Well, at last he
      couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He couldn&rsquo;t sleep nights, he couldn&rsquo;t eat,
      he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he da&rsquo;sn&rsquo;t ask anybody&rsquo;s advice, for
      the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the
      gov&rsquo;ment know about the letter. He had the letter buried under the floor,
      but that did no good; if he happened to see a person standing over the
      place it&rsquo;d give him the cold shivers, and loaded him up with suspicions,
      and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark, and then
      he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place. Of
      course, people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering,
      because, the way he was looking and acting, they judged he had killed
      somebody or done something terrible, they didn&rsquo;t know what, and if he had
      been a stranger they would&rsquo;ve lynched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, as I was saying, it got so he couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer; so he
      made up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the President
      of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing, not
      keeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the
      whole gov&rsquo;ment, and say, &ldquo;Now, there she is&mdash;do with me what you&rsquo;re a
      mind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and not
      deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family
      that must starve and yet hadn&rsquo;t had a thing to do with it, which is the
      whole truth and I can swear to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some
      stage-coaching, but all the rest of the way was horseback, and it took him
      three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of villages
      and four cities. He was gone &rsquo;most eight weeks, and there never was such a
      proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travels made him the
      greatest man in all that region, and the most talked about; and people
      come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and from over in
      the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him&mdash;and there they&rsquo;d
      stand and gawk, and he&rsquo;d gabble. You never see anything like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there wasn&rsquo;t any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler;
      some said it was Nat, some said it was Tom. Everybody allowed that Nat had
      seen the most longitude, but they had to give in that whatever Tom was
      short in longitude he had made up in latitude and climate. It was about a
      stand-off; so both of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures, and
      try to get ahead THAT way. That bullet-wound in Tom&rsquo;s leg was a tough
      thing for Nat Parsons to buck against, but he bucked the best he could;
      and at a disadvantage, too, for Tom didn&rsquo;t set still as he&rsquo;d orter done,
      to be fair, but always got up and sauntered around and worked his limp
      while Nat was painting up the adventure that HE had in Washington; for Tom
      never let go that limp when his leg got well, but practiced it nights at
      home, and kept it good as new right along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nat&rsquo;s adventure was like this; I don&rsquo;t know how true it is; maybe he got
      it out of a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that he DID
      know how to tell it. He could make anybody&rsquo;s flesh crawl, and he&rsquo;d turn
      pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and girls
      got so faint they couldn&rsquo;t stick it out. Well, it was this way, as near as
      I can remember:
    </p>
    <p>
      He come a-loping into Washington, and put up his horse and shoved out to
      the President&rsquo;s house with his letter, and they told him the President was
      up to the Capitol, and just going to start for Philadelphia&mdash;not a
      minute to lose if he wanted to catch him. Nat &rsquo;most dropped, it made him
      so sick. His horse was put up, and he didn&rsquo;t know what to do. But just
      then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack, and he see his
      chance. He rushes out and shouts: &ldquo;A half a dollar if you git me to the
      Capitol in half an hour, and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty
      minutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; says the darky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nat he jumped in and slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping and
      a-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it was
      something awful. Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on for
      life and death, but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the
      air, and the bottom fell out, and when it come down Nat&rsquo;s feet was on the
      ground, and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he couldn&rsquo;t keep
      up with the hack. He was horrible scared, but he laid into his work for
      all he was worth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and made his legs fairly
      fly. He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop, and so did the crowds
      along the street, for they could see his legs spinning along under the
      coach, and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows, and
      he was in awful danger; but the more they all shouted the more the nigger
      whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret,
      I&rsquo;se gwine to git you dah in time, boss; I&rsquo;s gwine to do it, sho&rsquo;!&rdquo; for
      you see he thought they were all hurrying him up, and, of course, he
      couldn&rsquo;t hear anything for the racket he was making. And so they went
      ripping along, and everybody just petrified to see it; and when they got
      to the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made, and
      everybody said so. The horses laid down, and Nat dropped, all tuckered
      out, and he was all dust and rags and barefooted; but he was in time and
      just in time, and caught the President and give him the letter, and
      everything was all right, and the President give him a free pardon on the
      spot, and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one, because
      he could see that if he hadn&rsquo;t had the hack he wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;a&rsquo; got there in
      time, nor anywhere near it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It WAS a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer had to work his
      bullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, by and by Tom&rsquo;s glory got to paling down gradu&rsquo;ly, on account of
      other things turning up for the people to talk about&mdash;first a
      horse-race, and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that the
      circus, and on top of that the eclipse; and that started a revival, same
      as it always does, and by that time there wasn&rsquo;t any more talk about Tom,
      so to speak, and you never see a person so sick and disgusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day
      out, and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about, he said it
      &rsquo;most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and him getting
      older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name for
      himself that he could see. Now that is the way boys is always thinking,
      but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated; and pretty
      soon he struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyer was
      always free and generous that way. There&rsquo;s a-plenty of boys that&rsquo;s mighty
      good and friendly when YOU&rsquo;VE got a good thing, but when a good thing
      happens to come their way they don&rsquo;t say a word to you, and try to hog it
      all. That warn&rsquo;t ever Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s way, I can say that for him. There&rsquo;s
      plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you when
      you&rsquo;ve got an apple and beg the core off of you; but when they&rsquo;ve got one,
      and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them a core one
      time, they say thank you &rsquo;most to death, but there ain&rsquo;t a-going to be no
      core. But I notice they always git come up with; all you got to do is to
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it was.
      It was a crusade.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0025}.jpg" alt="{0025}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0025}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a crusade?&rdquo; I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked scornful, the way he&rsquo;s always done when he was ashamed of a
      person, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don&rsquo;t know what a crusade is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t care to, nuther. I&rsquo;ve lived till now
      and done without it, and had my health, too. But as soon as you tell me,
      I&rsquo;ll know, and that&rsquo;s soon enough. I don&rsquo;t see any use in finding out
      things and clogging up my head with them when I mayn&rsquo;t ever have any
      occasion to use &rsquo;em. There was Lance Williams, he learned how to talk
      Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him. Now, then, what&rsquo;s a
      crusade? But I can tell you one thing before you begin; if it&rsquo;s a
      patent-right, there&rsquo;s no money in it. Bill Thompson he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patent-right!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I never see such an idiot. Why, a crusade is a
      kind of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought he must be losing his mind. But no, he was in real earnest, and
      went right on, perfectly ca&rsquo;m.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Holy Land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the Holy Land&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t but one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we want of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, can&rsquo;t you understand? It&rsquo;s in the hands of the paynim, and it&rsquo;s our
      duty to take it away from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did we come to let them git hold of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come to let them git hold of it. They always had it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tom, then it must belong to them, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why of course it does. Who said it didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I studied over it, but couldn&rsquo;t seem to git at the right of it, no way. I
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too many for me, Tom Sawyer. If I had a farm and it was mine, and
      another person wanted it, would it be right for him to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shucks! you don&rsquo;t know enough to come in when it rains, Huck Finn. It
      ain&rsquo;t a farm, it&rsquo;s entirely different. You see, it&rsquo;s like this. They own
      the land, just the mere land, and that&rsquo;s all they DO own; but it was our
      folks, our Jews and Christians, that made it holy, and so they haven&rsquo;t any
      business to be there defiling it. It&rsquo;s a shame, and we ought not to stand
      it a minute. We ought to march against them and take it away from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it does seem to me it&rsquo;s the most mixed-up thing I ever see! Now, if
      I had a farm and another person&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you it hasn&rsquo;t got anything to do with farming? Farming is
      business, just common low-down business: that&rsquo;s all it is, it&rsquo;s all you
      can say for it; but this is higher, this is religious, and totally
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; it&rsquo;s always been considered so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim he shook his head, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, I reckon dey&rsquo;s a mistake about it somers&mdash;dey mos&rsquo; sholy
      is. I&rsquo;s religious myself, en I knows plenty religious people, but I hain&rsquo;t
      run across none dat acts like dat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It made Tom hot, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s enough to make a body sick, such mullet-headed ignorance! If
      either of you&rsquo;d read anything about history, you&rsquo;d know that Richard Cur
      de Loon, and the Pope, and Godfrey de Bulleyn, and lots more of the most
      noble-hearted and pious people in the world, hacked and hammered at the
      paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their land away
      from them, and swum neck-deep in blood the whole time&mdash;and yet here&rsquo;s
      a couple of sap-headed country yahoos out in the backwoods of Missouri
      setting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it than
      they did! Talk about cheek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, of course, that put a more different light on it, and me and Jim
      felt pretty cheap and ignorant, and wished we hadn&rsquo;t been quite so
      chipper. I couldn&rsquo;t say nothing, and Jim he couldn&rsquo;t for a while; then he
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, den, I reckon it&rsquo;s all right; beca&rsquo;se ef dey didn&rsquo;t know, dey ain&rsquo;t
      no use for po&rsquo; ignorant folks like us to be trying to know; en so, ef it&rsquo;s
      our duty, we got to go en tackle it en do de bes&rsquo; we can. Same time, I
      feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom. De hard part gwine to be to
      kill folks dat a body hain&rsquo;t been &rsquo;quainted wid and dat hain&rsquo;t done him no
      harm. Dat&rsquo;s it, you see. Ef we wuz to go &rsquo;mongst &rsquo;em, jist we three, en
      say we&rsquo;s hungry, en ast &rsquo;em for a bite to eat, why, maybe dey&rsquo;s jist like
      yuther people. Don&rsquo;t you reckon dey is? Why, DEY&rsquo;D give it, I know dey
      would, en den&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mars Tom, my idea is like dis. It ain&rsquo;t no use, we CAN&rsquo;T kill dem
      po&rsquo; strangers dat ain&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; us no harm, till we&rsquo;ve had practice&mdash;I
      knows it perfectly well, Mars Tom&mdash;&rsquo;deed I knows it perfectly well.
      But ef we takes a&rsquo; axe or two, jist you en me en Huck, en slips acrost de
      river to-night arter de moon&rsquo;s gone down, en kills dat sick fam&rsquo;ly dat&rsquo;s
      over on the Sny, en burns dey house down, en&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you make me tired!&rdquo; says Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to argue any more with
      people like you and Huck Finn, that&rsquo;s always wandering from the subject,
      and ain&rsquo;t got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing that&rsquo;s pure
      theology by the laws that protect real estate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that&rsquo;s just where Tom Sawyer warn&rsquo;t fair. Jim didn&rsquo;t mean no harm, and
      I didn&rsquo;t mean no harm. We knowed well enough that he was right and we was
      wrong, and all we was after was to get at the HOW of it, and that was all;
      and the only reason he couldn&rsquo;t explain it so we could understand it was
      because we was ignorant&mdash;yes, and pretty dull, too, I ain&rsquo;t denying
      that; but, land! that ain&rsquo;t no crime, I should think.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he wouldn&rsquo;t hear no more about it&mdash;just said if we had tackled
      the thing in the proper spirit, he would &rsquo;a&rsquo; raised a couple of thousand
      knights and put them in steel armor from head to heel, and made me a
      lieutenant and Jim a sutler, and took the command himself and brushed the
      whole paynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across the world
      in a glory like sunset. But he said we didn&rsquo;t know enough to take the
      chance when we had it, and he wouldn&rsquo;t ever offer it again. And he didn&rsquo;t.
      When he once got set, you couldn&rsquo;t budge him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I didn&rsquo;t care much. I am peaceable, and don&rsquo;t get up rows with people
      that ain&rsquo;t doing nothing to me. I allowed if the paynim was satisfied I
      was, and we would let it stand at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scott&rsquo;s book, which he was
      always reading. And it WAS a wild notion, because in my opinion he never
      could&rsquo;ve raised the men, and if he did, as like as not he would&rsquo;ve got
      licked. I took the book and read all about it, and as near as I could make
      it out, most of the folks that shook farming to go crusading had a mighty
      rocky time of it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE BALLOON ASCENSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      WELL, Tom got up one thing after another, but they all had tender spots
      about &rsquo;em somewheres, and he had to shove &rsquo;em aside. So at last he was
      about in despair. Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good deal
      about the balloon that was going to sail to Europe, and Tom sort of
      thought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like, but couldn&rsquo;t
      make up his mind. But the papers went on talking, and so he allowed that
      maybe if he didn&rsquo;t go he mightn&rsquo;t ever have another chance to see a
      balloon; and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to see it,
      and that decided him, of course. He wasn&rsquo;t going to have Nat Parsons
      coming back bragging about seeing the balloon, and him having to listen to
      it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go too, and we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a noble big balloon, and had wings and fans and all sorts of
      things, and wasn&rsquo;t like any balloon you see in pictures. It was away out
      toward the edge of town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street; and
      there was a big crowd around it, making fun of it, and making fun of the
      man,&mdash;a lean pale feller with that soft kind of moonlight in his
      eyes, you know,&mdash;and they kept saying it wouldn&rsquo;t go. It made him hot
      to hear them, and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they
      was animals and blind, but some day they would find they had stood face to
      face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations,
      and was too dull to know it; and right here on this spot their own
      children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that would
      outlast a thousand years, but his name would outlast the monument. And
      then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, and yell at him, and ask
      him what was his name before he was married, and what he would take to not
      do it, and what was his sister&rsquo;s cat&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s name, and all the
      things that a crowd says when they&rsquo;ve got hold of a feller that they see
      they can plague. Well, some things they said WAS funny,&mdash;yes, and
      mighty witty too, I ain&rsquo;t denying that,&mdash;but all the same it warn&rsquo;t
      fair nor brave, all them people pitching on one, and they so glib and
      sharp, and him without any gift of talk to answer back with. But, good
      land! what did he want to sass back for? You see, it couldn&rsquo;t do him no
      good, and it was just nuts for them. They HAD him, you know. But that was
      his way. I reckon he couldn&rsquo;t help it; he was made so, I judge. He was a
      good enough sort of cretur, and hadn&rsquo;t no harm in him, and was just a
      genius, as the papers said, which wasn&rsquo;t his fault. We can&rsquo;t all be sound:
      we&rsquo;ve got to be the way we&rsquo;re made. As near as I can make out, geniuses
      think they know it all, and so they won&rsquo;t take people&rsquo;s advice, but always
      go their own way, which makes everybody forsake them and despise them, and
      that is perfectly natural. If they was humbler, and listened and tried to
      learn, it would be better for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The part the professor was in was like a boat, and was big and roomy, and
      had water-tight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of things in,
      and a body could sit on them, and make beds on them, too. We went aboard,
      and there was twenty people there, snooping around and examining, and old
      Nat Parsons was there, too. The professor kept fussing around getting
      ready, and the people went ashore, drifting out one at a time, and old Nat
      he was the last. Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t do to let him go out behind US. We
      mustn&rsquo;t budge till he was gone, so we could be last ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was gone now, so it was time for us to follow. I heard a big shout,
      and turned around&mdash;the city was dropping from under us like a shot!
      It made me sick all through, I was so scared. Jim turned gray and couldn&rsquo;t
      say a word, and Tom didn&rsquo;t say nothing, but looked excited. The city went
      on dropping down, and down, and down; but we didn&rsquo;t seem to be doing
      nothing but just hang in the air and stand still. The houses got smaller
      and smaller, and the city pulled itself together, closer and closer, and
      the men and wagons got to looking like ants and bugs crawling around, and
      the streets like threads and cracks; and then it all kind of melted
      together, and there wasn&rsquo;t any city any more it was only a big scar on the
      earth, and it seemed to me a body could see up the river and down the
      river about a thousand miles, though of course it wasn&rsquo;t so much. By and
      by the earth was a ball&mdash;just a round ball, of a dull color, with
      shiny stripes wriggling and winding around over it, which was rivers. The
      Widder Douglas always told me the earth was round like a ball, but I never
      took any stock in a lot of them superstitions o&rsquo; hers, and of course I
      paid no attention to that one, because I could see myself that the world
      was the shape of a plate, and flat. I used to go up on the hill, and take
      a look around and prove it for myself, because I reckon the best way to
      get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine for yourself, and not take
      anybody&rsquo;s say-so. But I had to give in now that the widder was right. That
      is, she was right as to the rest of the world, but she warn&rsquo;t right about
      the part our village is in; that part is the shape of a plate, and flat, I
      take my oath!
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor had been quiet all this time, as if he was asleep; but he
      broke loose now, and he was mighty bitter. He says something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiots! They said it wouldn&rsquo;t go; and they wanted to examine it, and spy
      around and get the secret of it out of me. But I beat them. Nobody knows
      the secret but me. Nobody knows what makes it move but me; and it&rsquo;s a new
      power&mdash;a new power, and a thousand times the strongest in the earth!
      Steam&rsquo;s foolishness to it! They said I couldn&rsquo;t go to Europe. To Europe!
      Why, there&rsquo;s power aboard to last five years, and feed for three months.
      They are fools! What do they know about it? Yes, and they said my air-ship
      was flimsy. Why, she&rsquo;s good for fifty years! I can sail the skies all my
      life if I want to, and steer where I please, though they laughed at that,
      and said I couldn&rsquo;t. Couldn&rsquo;t steer! Come here, boy; we&rsquo;ll see. You press
      these buttons as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way, and learnt him
      the whole thing in nearly no time; and Tom said it was perfectly easy. He
      made him fetch the ship down &rsquo;most to the earth, and had him spin her
      along so close to the Illinois prairies that a body could talk to the
      farmers, and hear everything they said perfectly plain; and he flung out
      printed bills to them that told about the balloon, and said it was going
      to Europe. Tom got so he could steer straight for a tree till he got
      nearly to it, and then dart up and skin right along over the top of it.
      Yes, and he showed Tom how to land her; and he done it first-rate, too,
      and set her down in the prairies as soft as wool. But the minute we
      started to skip out the professor says, &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and shot her up
      in the air again. It was awful. I begun to beg, and so did Jim; but it
      only give his temper a rise, and he begun to rage around and look wild out
      of his eyes, and I was scared of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then he got on to his troubles again, and mourned and grumbled about
      the way he was treated, and couldn&rsquo;t seem to git over it, and especially
      people&rsquo;s saying his ship was flimsy. He scoffed at that, and at their
      saying she warn&rsquo;t simple and would be always getting out of order. Get out
      of order! That graveled him; he said that she couldn&rsquo;t any more get out of
      order than the solar sister.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0033}.jpg" alt="{0033}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0033}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      He got worse and worse, and I never see a person take on so. It give me
      the cold shivers to see him, and so it did Jim. By and by he got to
      yelling and screaming, and then he swore the world shouldn&rsquo;t ever have his
      secret at all now, it had treated him so mean. He said he would sail his
      balloon around the globe just to show what he could do, and then he would
      sink it in the sea, and sink us all along with it, too. Well, it was the
      awfulest fix to be in, and here was night coming on!
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0037}.jpg" alt="{0037}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0037}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      He give us something to eat, and made us go to the other end of the boat,
      and he laid down on a locker, where he could boss all the works, and put
      his old pepper-box revolver under his head, and said if anybody come
      fooling around there trying to land her, he would kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set scrunched up together, and thought considerable, but didn&rsquo;t say
      much&mdash;only just a word once in a while when a body had to say
      something or bust, we was so scared and worried. The night dragged along
      slow and lonesome. We was pretty low down, and the moonshine made
      everything soft and pretty, and the farmhouses looked snug and homeful,
      and we could hear the farm sounds, and wished we could be down there; but,
      laws! we just slipped along over them like a ghost, and never left a
      track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away in the night, when all the sounds was late sounds, and the air had a
      late feel, and a late smell, too&mdash;about a two-o&rsquo;clock feel, as near
      as I could make out&mdash;Tom said the professor was so quiet this time he
      must be asleep, and we&rsquo;d better&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better what?&rdquo; I says in a whisper, and feeling sick all over, because I
      knowed what he was thinking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better slip back there and tie him, and land the ship,&rdquo; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      I says: &ldquo;No, sir! Don&rsquo; you budge, Tom Sawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jim&mdash;well, Jim was kind o&rsquo; gasping, he was so scared. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mars Tom, DON&rsquo;T! Ef you teches him, we&rsquo;s gone&mdash;we&rsquo;s gone sho&rsquo;! I
      ain&rsquo;t gwine anear him, not for nothin&rsquo; in dis worl&rsquo;. Mars Tom, he&rsquo;s plumb
      crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom whispers and says&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s WHY we&rsquo;ve got to do something. If he
      wasn&rsquo;t crazy I wouldn&rsquo;t give shucks to be anywhere but here; you couldn&rsquo;t
      hire me to get out&mdash;now that I&rsquo;ve got used to this balloon and over
      the scare of being cut loose from the solid ground&mdash;if he was in his
      right mind. But it&rsquo;s no good politics, sailing around like this with a
      person that&rsquo;s out of his head, and says he&rsquo;s going round the world and
      then drown us all. We&rsquo;ve GOT to do something, I tell you, and do it before
      he wakes up, too, or we mayn&rsquo;t ever get another chance. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it, and we said we
      wouldn&rsquo;t budge. So Tom was for slipping back there by himself to see if he
      couldn&rsquo;t get at the steering-gear and land the ship. We begged and begged
      him not to, but it warn&rsquo;t no use; so he got down on his hands and knees,
      and begun to crawl an inch at a time, we a-holding our breath and
      watching. After he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower than
      ever, and it did seem like years to me. But at last we see him get to the
      professor&rsquo;s head, and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in his
      face and listen. Then we see him begin to inch along again toward the
      professor&rsquo;s feet where the steering-buttons was. Well, he got there all
      safe, and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons, but he knocked
      down something that made a noise, and we see him slump down flat an&rsquo; soft
      in the bottom, and lay still. The professor stirred, and says, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo; But everybody kept dead still and quiet, and he begun to mutter and
      mumble and nestle, like a person that&rsquo;s going to wake up, and I thought I
      was going to die, I was so worried and scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a cloud slid over the moon, and I &rsquo;most cried, I was so glad. She
      buried herself deeper and deeper into the cloud, and it got so dark we
      couldn&rsquo;t see Tom. Then it began to sprinkle rain, and we could hear the
      professor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather. We was
      afraid every minute he would touch Tom, and then we would be goners, and
      no help; but Tom was already on his way back, and when we felt his hands
      on our knees my breath stopped sudden, and my heart fell down &rsquo;mongst my
      other works, because I couldn&rsquo;t tell in the dark but it might be the
      professor! which I thought it WAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear! I was so glad to have him back that I was just as near happy as a
      person could be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man. You
      can&rsquo;t land a balloon in the dark, and so I hoped it would keep on raining,
      for I didn&rsquo;t want Tom to go meddling any more and make us so awful
      uncomfortable. Well, I got my wish. It drizzled and drizzled along the
      rest of the night, which wasn&rsquo;t long, though it did seem so; and at
      daybreak it cleared, and the world looked mighty soft and gray and pretty,
      and the forests and fields so good to see again, and the horses and cattle
      standing sober and thinking. Next, the sun come a-blazing up gay and
      splendid, and then we began to feel rusty and stretchy, and first we
      knowed we was all asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. TOM EXPLAINS
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE went to sleep about four o&rsquo;clock, and woke up about eight. The
      professor was setting back there at his end, looking glum. He pitched us
      some breakfast, but he told us not to come abaft the midship compass. That
      was about the middle of the boat. Well, when you are sharp-set, and you
      eat and satisfy yourself, everything looks pretty different from what it
      done before. It makes a body feel pretty near comfortable, even when he is
      up in a balloon with a genius. We got to talking together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one thing that kept bothering me, and by and by I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, didn&rsquo;t we start east?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fast have we been going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you heard what the professor said when he was raging round.
      Sometimes, he said, we was making fifty miles an hour, sometimes ninety,
      sometimes a hundred; said that with a gale to help he could make three
      hundred any time, and said if he wanted the gale, and wanted it blowing
      the right direction, he only had to go up higher or down lower to find
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it&rsquo;s just as I reckoned. The professor lied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if we was going so fast we ought to be past Illinois, oughtn&rsquo;t
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason we ain&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know by the color. We&rsquo;re right over Illinois yet. And you can see for
      yourself that Indiana ain&rsquo;t in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Huck. You know by the COLOR?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the color got to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got everything to do with it. Illinois is green, Indiana is pink.
      You show me any pink down here, if you can. No, sir; it&rsquo;s green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indiana PINK? Why, what a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no lie; I&rsquo;ve seen it on the map, and it&rsquo;s pink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You never see a person so aggravated and disgusted. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I was such a numbskull as you, Huck Finn, I would jump over.
      Seen it on the map! Huck Finn, did you reckon the States was the same
      color out-of-doors as they are on the map?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, what&rsquo;s a map for? Ain&rsquo;t it to learn you facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, how&rsquo;s it going to do that if it tells lies? That&rsquo;s what I
      want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, you muggins! It don&rsquo;t tell lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then; if it don&rsquo;t, there ain&rsquo;t no two States the same color.
      You git around THAT if you can, Tom Sawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He see I had him, and Jim see it too; and I tell you, I felt pretty good,
      for Tom Sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of. Jim slapped his
      leg and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell YOU! dat&rsquo;s smart, dat&rsquo;s right down smart. Ain&rsquo;t no use, Mars Tom;
      he got you DIS time, sho&rsquo;!&rdquo; He slapped his leg again, and says, &ldquo;My LAN&rsquo;,
      but it was smart one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never felt so good in my life; and yet I didn&rsquo;t know I was saying
      anything much till it was out. I was just mooning along, perfectly
      careless, and not expecting anything was going to happen, and never
      THINKING of such a thing at all, when, all of a sudden, out it came. Why,
      it was just as much a surprise to me as it was to any of them. It was just
      the same way it is when a person is munching along on a hunk of corn-pone,
      and not thinking about anything, and all of a sudden bites into a di&rsquo;mond.
      Now all that HE knows first off is that it&rsquo;s some kind of gravel he&rsquo;s bit
      into; but he don&rsquo;t find out it&rsquo;s a di&rsquo;mond till he gits it out and brushes
      off the sand and crumbs and one thing or another, and has a look at it,
      and then he&rsquo;s surprised and glad&mdash;yes, and proud too; though when you
      come to look the thing straight in the eye, he ain&rsquo;t entitled to as much
      credit as he would &rsquo;a&rsquo; been if he&rsquo;d been HUNTING di&rsquo;monds. You can see the
      difference easy if you think it over. You see, an accident, that way,
      ain&rsquo;t fairly as big a thing as a thing that&rsquo;s done a-purpose. Anybody
      could find that di&rsquo;mond in that corn-pone; but mind you, it&rsquo;s got to be
      somebody that&rsquo;s got THAT KIND OF A CORN-PONE. That&rsquo;s where that feller&rsquo;s
      credit comes in, you see; and that&rsquo;s where mine comes in. I don&rsquo;t claim no
      great things&mdash;I don&rsquo;t reckon I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; done it again&mdash;but I
      done it that time; that&rsquo;s all I claim. And I hadn&rsquo;t no more idea I could
      do such a thing, and warn&rsquo;t any more thinking about it or trying to, than
      you be this minute. Why, I was just as ca&rsquo;m, a body couldn&rsquo;t be any
      ca&rsquo;mer, and yet, all of a sudden, out it come. I&rsquo;ve often thought of that
      time, and I can remember just the way everything looked, same as if it was
      only last week. I can see it all: beautiful rolling country with woods and
      fields and lakes for hundreds and hundreds of miles all around, and towns
      and villages scattered everywheres under us, here and there and yonder;
      and the professor mooning over a chart on his little table, and Tom&rsquo;s cap
      flopping in the rigging where it was hung up to dry. And one thing in
      particular was a bird right alongside, not ten foot off, going our way and
      trying to keep up, but losing ground all the time; and a railroad train
      doing the same thing down there, sliding among the trees and farms, and
      pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now and then a little puff of
      white; and when the white was gone so long you had almost forgot it, you
      would hear a little faint toot, and that was the whistle. And we left the
      bird and the train both behind, &rsquo;WAY behind, and done it easy, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom he was huffy, and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorant
      blatherskites, and then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose there&rsquo;s a brown calf and a big brown dog, and an artist is making
      a picture of them. What is the MAIN thing that that artist has got to do?
      He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute you look at
      them, hain&rsquo;t he? Of course. Well, then, do you want him to go and paint
      BOTH of them brown? Certainly you don&rsquo;t. He paints one of them blue, and
      then you can&rsquo;t make no mistake. It&rsquo;s just the same with the maps. That&rsquo;s
      why they make every State a different color; it ain&rsquo;t to deceive you, it&rsquo;s
      to keep you from deceiving yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I couldn&rsquo;t see no argument about that, and neither could Jim. Jim
      shook his head, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, if you knowed what chuckle-heads dem painters is, you&rsquo;d
      wait a long time before you&rsquo;d fetch one er DEM in to back up a fac&rsquo;. I&rsquo;s
      gwine to tell you, den you kin see for you&rsquo;self. I see one of &rsquo;em
      a-paintin&rsquo; away, one day, down in ole Hank Wilson&rsquo;s back lot, en I went
      down to see, en he was paintin&rsquo; dat old brindle cow wid de near horn gone&mdash;you
      knows de one I means. En I ast him what he&rsquo;s paintin&rsquo; her for, en he say
      when he git her painted, de picture&rsquo;s wuth a hundred dollars. Mars Tom, he
      could a got de cow fer fifteen, en I tole him so. Well, sah, if you&rsquo;ll
      b&rsquo;lieve me, he jes&rsquo; shuck his head, dat painter did, en went on a-dobbin&rsquo;.
      Bless you, Mars Tom, DEY don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom lost his temper. I notice a person &rsquo;most always does that&rsquo;s got laid
      out in an argument. He told us to shut up, and maybe we&rsquo;d feel better.
      Then he see a town clock away off down yonder, and he took up the glass
      and looked at it, and then looked at his silver turnip, and then at the
      clock, and then at the turnip again, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny! That clock&rsquo;s near about an hour fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he put up his turnip. Then he see another clock, and took a look, and
      it was an hour fast too. That puzzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mighty curious thing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took the glass and hunted up another clock, and sure enough it was
      an hour fast too. Then his eyes began to spread and his breath to come out
      kinder gaspy like, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ger-reat Scott, it&rsquo;s the LONGITUDE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I says, considerably scared:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s been and gone and happened now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the thing that&rsquo;s happened is that this old bladder has slid over
      Illinois and Indiana and Ohio like nothing, and this is the east end of
      Pennsylvania or New York, or somewheres around there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, you don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, and it&rsquo;s dead sure. We&rsquo;ve covered about fifteen degrees of
      longitude since we left St. Louis yesterday afternoon, and them clocks are
      right. We&rsquo;ve come close on to eight hundred miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t believe it, but it made the cold streaks trickle down my back
      just the same. In my experience I knowed it wouldn&rsquo;t take much short of
      two weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft. Jim was working his
      mind and studying. Pretty soon he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, did you say dem clocks uz right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; watch right, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right for St. Louis, but she&rsquo;s an hour wrong for here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, is you tryin&rsquo; to let on dat de time ain&rsquo;t de SAME everywheres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t the same everywheres, by a long shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim looked distressed, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It grieves me to hear you talk like dat, Mars Tom; I&rsquo;s right down ashamed
      to hear you talk like dat, arter de way you&rsquo;s been raised. Yassir, it&rsquo;d
      break yo&rsquo; Aunt Polly&rsquo;s heart to hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was astonished. He looked Jim over wondering, and didn&rsquo;t say nothing,
      and Jim went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, who put de people out yonder in St. Louis? De Lord done it. Who
      put de people here whar we is? De Lord done it. Ain&rsquo; dey bofe his
      children? &rsquo;Cose dey is. WELL, den! is he gwine to SCRIMINATE &rsquo;twixt &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scriminate! I never heard such ignorance. There ain&rsquo;t no discriminating
      about it. When he makes you and some more of his children black, and makes
      the rest of us white, what do you call that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim see the p&rsquo;int. He was stuck. He couldn&rsquo;t answer. Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does discriminate, you see, when he wants to; but this case HERE ain&rsquo;t
      no discrimination of his, it&rsquo;s man&rsquo;s. The Lord made the day, and he made
      the night; but he didn&rsquo;t invent the hours, and he didn&rsquo;t distribute them
      around. Man did that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, is dat so? Man done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who tole him he could?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody. He never asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim studied a minute, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dat do beat me. I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; tuck no sich resk. But some people
      ain&rsquo;t scared o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;. Dey bangs right ahead; DEY don&rsquo;t care what
      happens. So den dey&rsquo;s allays an hour&rsquo;s diff&rsquo;unce everywhah, Mars Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour? No! It&rsquo;s four minutes difference for every degree of longitude,
      you know. Fifteen of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s an hour, thirty of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s two hours, and so on.
      When it&rsquo;s one clock Tuesday morning in England, it&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock the
      night before in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim moved a little way along the locker, and you could see he was
      insulted. He kept shaking his head and muttering, and so I slid along to
      him and patted him on the leg, and petted him up, and got him over the
      worst of his feelings, and then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom talkin&rsquo; sich talk as dat! Choosday in one place en Monday in
      t&rsquo;other, bofe in the same day! Huck, dis ain&rsquo;t no place to joke&mdash;up
      here whah we is. Two days in one day! How you gwine to get two days inter
      one day? Can&rsquo;t git two hours inter one hour, kin you? Can&rsquo;t git two
      niggers inter one nigger skin, kin you? Can&rsquo;t git two gallons of whisky
      inter a one-gallon jug, kin you? No, sir, &rsquo;twould strain de jug. Yes, en
      even den you couldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t believe. Why, looky here, Huck, s&rsquo;posen de
      Choosday was New Year&rsquo;s&mdash;now den! is you gwine to tell me it&rsquo;s dis
      year in one place en las&rsquo; year in t&rsquo;other, bofe in de identical same
      minute? It&rsquo;s de beatenest rubbage! I can&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; to
      hear tell &rsquo;bout it.&rdquo; Then he begun to shiver and turn gray, and Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOW what&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim could hardly speak, but he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, you ain&rsquo;t jokin&rsquo;, en it&rsquo;s SO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not, and it is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim shivered again, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Den dat Monday could be de las&rsquo; day, en dey wouldn&rsquo;t be no las&rsquo; day in
      England, en de dead wouldn&rsquo;t be called. We mustn&rsquo;t go over dah, Mars Tom.
      Please git him to turn back; I wants to be whah&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All of a sudden we see something, and all jumped up, and forgot everything
      and begun to gaze. Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that the&mdash;&rdquo; He catched his breath, then says: &ldquo;It IS, sure as
      you live! It&rsquo;s the ocean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That made me and Jim catch our breath, too. Then we all stood petrified
      but happy, for none of us had ever seen an ocean, or ever expected to. Tom
      kept muttering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atlantic Ocean&mdash;Atlantic. Land, don&rsquo;t it sound great! And that&rsquo;s IT&mdash;and
      WE are looking at it&mdash;we! Why, it&rsquo;s just too splendid to believe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we see a big bank of black smoke; and when we got nearer, it was a
      city&mdash;and a monster she was, too, with a thick fringe of ships around
      one edge; and we wondered if it was New York, and begun to jaw and dispute
      about it, and, first we knowed, it slid from under us and went flying
      behind, and here we was, out over the very ocean itself, and going like a
      cyclone. Then we woke up, I tell you!
    </p>
    <p>
      We made a break aft and raised a wail, and begun to beg the professor to
      turn back and land us, but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us back,
      and we went, but nobody will ever know how bad we felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land was gone, all but a little streak, like a snake, away off on the
      edge of the water, and down under us was just ocean, ocean, ocean&mdash;millions
      of miles of it, heaving and pitching and squirming, and white sprays
      blowing from the wave-tops, and only a few ships in sight, wallowing
      around and laying over, first on one side and then on t&rsquo;other, and
      sticking their bows under and then their sterns; and before long there
      warn&rsquo;t no ships at all, and we had the sky and the whole ocean all to
      ourselves, and the roomiest place I ever see and the lonesomest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. STORM
    </h2>
    <p>
      AND it got lonesomer and lonesomer. There was the big sky up there, empty
      and awful deep; and the ocean down there without a thing on it but just
      the waves. All around us was a ring, where the sky and the water come
      together; yes, a monstrous big ring it was, and we right in the dead
      center of it&mdash;plumb in the center. We was racing along like a prairie
      fire, but it never made any difference, we couldn&rsquo;t seem to git past that
      center no way. I couldn&rsquo;t see that we ever gained an inch on that ring. It
      made a body feel creepy, it was so curious and unaccountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very low
      voice, and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less talky,
      till at last the talk ran dry altogether, and we just set there and
      &ldquo;thunk,&rdquo; as Jim calls it, and never said a word the longest time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor never stirred till the sun was overhead, then he stood up
      and put a kind of triangle to his eye, and Tom said it was a sextant and
      he was taking the sun to see whereabouts the balloon was. Then he ciphered
      a little and looked in a book, and then he begun to carry on again. He
      said lots of wild things, and, among others, he said he would keep up this
      hundred-mile gait till the middle of to-morrow afternoon, and then he&rsquo;d
      land in London.

    <p>
      We said we would be humbly thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was turning away, but he whirled around when we said that, and give us
      a long look of his blackest kind&mdash;one of the maliciousest and
      suspiciousest looks I ever see. Then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to leave me. Don&rsquo;t try to deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0053}.jpg" alt="{0053}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0053}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so we held in and didn&rsquo;t say nothing at all.

      He went aft and set down, but he couldn&rsquo;t seem to git that thing out of
      his mind. Every now and then he would rip out something about it, and try
      to make us answer him, but we dasn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      It got lonesomer and lonesomer right along, and it did seem to me I
      couldn&rsquo;t stand it. It was still worse when night begun to come on. By and
      by Tom pinched me and whispers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took a glance aft, and see the professor taking a whet out of a bottle.
      I didn&rsquo;t like the looks of that. By and by he took another drink, and
      pretty soon he begun to sing. It was dark now, and getting black and
      stormy. He went on singing, wilder and wilder, and the thunder begun to
      mutter, and the wind to wheeze and moan among the ropes, and altogether it
      was awful. It got so black we couldn&rsquo;t see him any more, and wished we
      couldn&rsquo;t hear him, but we could. Then he got still; but he warn&rsquo;t still
      ten minutes till we got suspicious, and wished he would start up his noise
      again, so we could tell where he was. By and by there was a flash of
      lightning, and we see him start to get up, but he staggered and fell down.
      We heard him scream out in the dark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to go to England. All right, I&rsquo;ll change the course. They
      want to leave me. I know they do. Well, they shall&mdash;and NOW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I &rsquo;most died when he said that. Then he was still again&mdash;still so
      long I couldn&rsquo;t bear it, and it did seem to me the lightning wouldn&rsquo;t EVER
      come again. But at last there was a blessed flash, and there he was, on
      his hands and knees crawling, and not four feet from us. My, but his eyes
      was terrible! He made a lunge for Tom, and says, &ldquo;Overboard YOU go!&rdquo; but
      it was already pitch-dark again, and I couldn&rsquo;t see whether he got him or
      not, and Tom didn&rsquo;t make a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another long, horrible wait; then there was a flash, and I see
      Tom&rsquo;s head sink down outside the boat and disappear. He was on the
      rope-ladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel. The professor
      let off a shout and jumped for him, and straight off it was pitch-dark
      again, and Jim groaned out, &ldquo;Po&rsquo; Mars Tom, he&rsquo;s a goner!&rdquo; and made a jump
      for the professor, but the professor warn&rsquo;t there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we heard a couple of terrible screams, and then another not so loud,
      and then another that was &rsquo;way below, and you could only JUST hear it; and
      I heard Jim say, &ldquo;Po&rsquo; Mars Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was awful still, and I reckon a person could &rsquo;a&rsquo; counted four
      thousand before the next flash come. When it come I see Jim on his knees,
      with his arms on the locker and his face buried in them, and he was
      crying. Before I could look over the edge it was all dark again, and I was
      glad, because I didn&rsquo;t want to see. But when the next flash come, I was
      watching, and down there I see somebody a-swinging in the wind on the
      ladder, and it was Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up!&rdquo; I shouts; &ldquo;come up, Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was so weak, and the wind roared so, I couldn&rsquo;t make out what he
      said, but I thought he asked was the professor up there. I shouts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s down in the ocean! Come up! Can we help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, all this in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck, who is you hollerin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hollerin&rsquo; at Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Huck, how kin you act so, when you know po&rsquo; Mars Tom&mdash;&rdquo; Then he
      let off an awful scream, and flung his head and his arms back and let off
      another one, because there was a white glare just then, and he had raised
      up his face just in time to see Tom&rsquo;s, as white as snow, rise above the
      gunnel and look him right in the eye. He thought it was Tom&rsquo;s ghost, you
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom clumb aboard, and when Jim found it WAS him, and not his ghost, he
      hugged him, and called him all sorts of loving names, and carried on like
      he was gone crazy, he was so glad. Says I:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you wait for, Tom? Why didn&rsquo;t you come up at first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dasn&rsquo;t, Huck. I knowed somebody plunged down past me, but I didn&rsquo;t know
      who it was in the dark. It could &rsquo;a&rsquo; been you, it could &rsquo;a&rsquo; been Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the way with Tom Sawyer&mdash;always sound. He warn&rsquo;t coming up
      till he knowed where the professor was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm let go about this time with all its might; and it was dreadful
      the way the thunder boomed and tore, and the lightning glared out, and the
      wind sung and screamed in the rigging, and the rain come down. One second
      you couldn&rsquo;t see your hand before you, and the next you could count the
      threads in your coat-sleeve, and see a whole wide desert of waves pitching
      and tossing through a kind of veil of rain. A storm like that is the
      loveliest thing there is, but it ain&rsquo;t at its best when you are up in the
      sky and lost, and it&rsquo;s wet and lonesome, and there&rsquo;s just been a death in
      the family.

    <p>
      We set there huddled up in the bow, and talked low about the poor
      professor; and everybody was sorry for him, and sorry the world had made
      fun of him and treated him so harsh, when he was doing the best he could,
      and hadn&rsquo;t a friend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him from brooding
      his mind away and going deranged. There was plenty of clothes and blankets
      and everything at the other end, but we thought we&rsquo;d ruther take the rain
      than go meddling back there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. LAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE tried to make some plans, but we couldn&rsquo;t come to no agreement. Me and
      Jim was for turning around and going back home, but Tom allowed that by
      the time daylight come, so we could see our way, we would be so far toward
      England that we might as well go there, and come back in a ship, and have
      the glory of saying we done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the ocean,
      and we begun to feel comfortable and drowsy; so we stretched out on the
      lockers and went to sleep, and never woke up again till sun-up. The sea
      was sparkling like di&rsquo;monds, and it was nice weather, and pretty soon our
      things was all dry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went aft to find some breakfast, and the first thing we noticed was
      that there was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood.
      Then Tom was disturbed. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what that means, easy enough. It means that somebody has got to
      stay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship, or she&rsquo;ll
      wander around and go wherever the wind wants her to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s she been doing since&mdash;er&mdash;since we had
      the accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wandering,&rdquo; he says, kinder troubled&mdash;&ldquo;wandering, without any doubt.
      She&rsquo;s in a wind now that&rsquo;s blowing her south of east. We don&rsquo;t know how
      long that&rsquo;s been going on, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So then he p&rsquo;inted her east, and said he would hold her there till we
      rousted out the breakfast. The professor had laid in everything a body
      could want; he couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been better fixed. There wasn&rsquo;t no milk for
      the coffee, but there was water, and everything else you could want, and a
      charcoal stove and the fixings for it, and pipes and cigars and matches;
      and wine and liquor, which warn&rsquo;t in our line; and books, and maps, and
      charts, and an accordion; and furs, and blankets, and no end of rubbish,
      like brass beads and brass jewelry, which Tom said was a sure sign that he
      had an idea of visiting among savages. There was money, too. Yes, the
      professor was well enough fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to steer, and divided us all up
      into four-hour watches, turn and turn about; and when his watch was out I
      took his place, and he got out the professor&rsquo;s papers and pens and wrote a
      letter home to his aunt Polly, telling her everything that had happened to
      us, and dated it &ldquo;IN THE WELKIN, APPROACHING ENGLAND,&rdquo; and folded it
      together and stuck it fast with a red wafer, and directed it, and wrote
      above the direction, in big writing, &ldquo;FROM TOM SAWYER, THE ERRONORT,&rdquo; and
      said it would stump old Nat Parsons, the postmaster, when it come along in
      the mail. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, this ain&rsquo;t no welkin, it&rsquo;s a balloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, who SAID it was a welkin, smarty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve wrote it on the letter, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? That don&rsquo;t mean that the balloon&rsquo;s the welkin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought it did. Well, then, what is a welkin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I see in a minute he was stuck. He raked and scraped around in his mind,
      but he couldn&rsquo;t find nothing, so he had to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and nobody don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just a word, and it&rsquo;s a mighty
      good word, too. There ain&rsquo;t many that lays over it. I don&rsquo;t believe
      there&rsquo;s ANY that does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;But what does it MEAN?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the p&rsquo;int.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it means, I tell you. It&rsquo;s a word that people uses for&mdash;for&mdash;well,
      it&rsquo;s ornamental. They don&rsquo;t put ruffles on a shirt to keep a person warm,
      do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they put them ON, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then; that letter I wrote is a shirt, and the welkin&rsquo;s the
      ruffle on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I judged that that would gravel Jim, and it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mars Tom, it ain&rsquo;t no use to talk like dat; en, moreover, it&rsquo;s
      sinful. You knows a letter ain&rsquo;t no shirt, en dey ain&rsquo;t no ruffles on it,
      nuther. Dey ain&rsquo;t no place to put &rsquo;em on; you can&rsquo;t put em on, and dey
      wouldn&rsquo;t stay ef you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh DO shut up, and wait till something&rsquo;s started that you know something
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, sholy you can&rsquo;t mean to say I don&rsquo;t know about shirts,
      when, goodness knows, I&rsquo;s toted home de washin&rsquo; ever sence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, this hasn&rsquo;t got anything to do with shirts. I only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, you said yo&rsquo;self dat a letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to drive me crazy? Keep still. I only used it as a metaphor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That word kinder bricked us up for a minute. Then Jim says&mdash;rather
      timid, because he see Tom was getting pretty tetchy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, what is a metaphor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A metaphor&rsquo;s a&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s a&mdash;a&mdash;a metaphor&rsquo;s an
      illustration.&rdquo; He see THAT didn&rsquo;t git home, so he tried again. &ldquo;When I say
      birds of a feather flocks together, it&rsquo;s a metaphorical way of saying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dey DON&rsquo;T, Mars Tom. No, sir, &rsquo;deed dey don&rsquo;t. Dey ain&rsquo;t no feathers
      dat&rsquo;s more alike den a bluebird en a jaybird, but ef you waits till you
      catches dem birds together, you&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, give us a rest! You can&rsquo;t get the simplest little thing through your
      thick skull. Now don&rsquo;t bother me any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim was satisfied to stop. He was dreadful pleased with himself for
      catching Tom out. The minute Tom begun to talk about birds I judged he was
      a goner, because Jim knowed more about birds than both of us put together.
      You see, he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them, and that&rsquo;s the way
      to find out about birds. That&rsquo;s the way people does that writes books
      about birds, and loves them so that they&rsquo;ll go hungry and tired and take
      any amount of trouble to find a new bird and kill it. Their name is
      ornithologers, and I could have been an ornithologer myself, because I
      always loved birds and creatures; and I started out to learn how to be
      one, and I see a bird setting on a limb of a high tree, singing with its
      head tilted back and its mouth open, and before I thought I fired, and his
      song stopped and he fell straight down from the limb, all limp like a rag,
      and I run and picked him up and he was dead, and his body was warm in my
      hand, and his head rolled about this way and that, like his neck was
      broke, and there was a little white skin over his eyes, and one little
      drop of blood on the side of his head; and, laws! I couldn&rsquo;t see nothing
      more for the tears; and I hain&rsquo;t never murdered no creature since that
      warn&rsquo;t doing me no harm, and I ain&rsquo;t going to.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was aggravated about that welkin. I wanted to know. I got the
      subject up again, and then Tom explained, the best he could. He said when
      a person made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of the people
      made the welkin ring. He said they always said that, but none of them ever
      told what it was, so he allowed it just meant outdoors and up high. Well,
      that seemed sensible enough, so I was satisfied, and said so. That pleased
      Tom and put him in a good humor again, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all right, then; and we&rsquo;ll let bygones be bygones. I don&rsquo;t
      know for certain what a welkin is, but when we land in London we&rsquo;ll make
      it ring, anyway, and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons; and said
      it was a mighty sight finer to be Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to be Tom
      Sawyer the Traveler, and we would be heard of all round the world, if we
      pulled through all right, and so he wouldn&rsquo;t give shucks to be a traveler
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the middle of the afternoon we got everything ready to land, and we
      felt pretty good, too, and proud; and we kept watching with the glasses,
      like Columbus discovering America. But we couldn&rsquo;t see nothing but ocean.
      The afternoon wasted out and the sun shut down, and still there warn&rsquo;t no
      land anywheres. We wondered what was the matter, but reckoned it would
      come out all right, so we went on steering east, but went up on a higher
      level so we wouldn&rsquo;t hit any steeples or mountains in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my watch till midnight, and then it was Jim&rsquo;s; but Tom stayed up,
      because he said ship captains done that when they was making the land, and
      didn&rsquo;t stand no regular watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, when daylight come, Jim give a shout, and we jumped up and looked
      over, and there was the land sure enough&mdash;land all around, as far as
      you could see, and perfectly level and yaller. We didn&rsquo;t know how long
      we&rsquo;d been over it. There warn&rsquo;t no trees, nor hills, nor rocks, nor towns,
      and Tom and Jim had took it for the sea. They took it for the sea in a
      dead ca&rsquo;m; but we was so high up, anyway, that if it had been the sea and
      rough, it would &rsquo;a&rsquo; looked smooth, all the same, in the night, that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We was all in a powerful excitement now, and grabbed the glasses and
      hunted everywheres for London, but couldn&rsquo;t find hair nor hide of it, nor
      any other settlement&mdash;nor any sign of a lake or a river, either. Tom
      was clean beat. He said it warn&rsquo;t his notion of England; he thought
      England looked like America, and always had that idea. So he said we
      better have breakfast, and then drop down and inquire the quickest way to
      London. We cut the breakfast pretty short, we was so impatient. As we
      slanted along down, the weather began to moderate, and pretty soon we shed
      our furs. But it kept ON moderating, and in a precious little while it was
      &rsquo;most too moderate. We was close down now, and just blistering!
    </p>
    <p>
      We settled down to within thirty foot of the land&mdash;that is, it was
      land if sand is land; for this wasn&rsquo;t anything but pure sand. Tom and me
      clumb down the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs, and it felt
      amazing good&mdash;that is, the stretching did, but the sand scorched our
      feet like hot embers. Next, we see somebody coming, and started to meet
      him; but we heard Jim shout, and looked around and he was fairly dancing,
      and making signs, and yelling. We couldn&rsquo;t make out what he said, but we
      was scared anyway, and begun to heel it back to the balloon. When we got
      close enough, we understood the words, and they made me sick:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run! Run fo&rsquo; yo&rsquo; life! Hit&rsquo;s a lion; I kin see him thoo de glass! Run,
      boys; do please heel it de bes&rsquo; you kin. He&rsquo;s bu&rsquo;sted outen de menagerie,
      en dey ain&rsquo;t nobody to stop him!&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0065}.jpg" alt="{0065}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0065}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      It made Tom fly, but it took the stiffening all out of my legs. I could
      only just gasp along the way you do in a dream when there&rsquo;s a ghost
      gaining on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me; and as
      soon as I got a foothold on it he shouted to Jim to soar away. But Jim had
      clean lost his head, and said he had forgot how. So Tom shinned along up
      and told me to follow; but the lion was arriving, fetching a most ghastly
      roar with every lope, and my legs shook so I dasn&rsquo;t try to take one of
      them out of the rounds for fear the other one would give way under me.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0069}.jpg" alt="{0069}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0069}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      But Tom was aboard by this time, and he started the balloon up a little,
      and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelve
      feet above ground. And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me, and
      roaring and springing up in the air at the ladder, and only missing it
      about a quarter of an inch, it seemed to me. It was delicious to be out of
      his reach, perfectly delicious, and made me feel good and thankful all up
      one side; but I was hanging there helpless and couldn&rsquo;t climb, and that
      made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down the other. It is
      most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that; and it is not to be
      recommended, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom asked me what he&rsquo;d better do, but I didn&rsquo;t know. He asked me if I
      could hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion
      behind. I said I could if he didn&rsquo;t go no higher than he was now; but if
      he went higher I would lose my head and fall, sure. So he said, &ldquo;Take a
      good grip,&rdquo; and he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go so fast,&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;It makes my head swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had started like a lightning express. He slowed down, and we glided
      over the sand slower, but still in a kind of sickening way; for it IS
      uncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that, and
      not a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      But pretty soon there was plenty of sound, for the lion was catching up.
      His noise fetched others. You could see them coming on the lope from every
      direction, and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of them under me,
      jumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at each other; and so
      we went skimming along over the sand, and these fellers doing what they
      could to help us to not forgit the occasion; and then some other beasts
      come, without an invite, and they started a regular riot down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see this plan was a mistake. We couldn&rsquo;t ever git away from them at
      this gait, and I couldn&rsquo;t hold on forever. So Tom took a think, and struck
      another idea. That was, to kill a lion with the pepper-box revolver, and
      then sail away while the others stopped to fight over the carcass. So he
      stopped the balloon still, and done it, and then we sailed off while the
      fuss was going on, and come down a quarter of a mile off, and they helped
      me aboard; but by the time we was out of reach again, that gang was on
      hand once more. And when they see we was really gone and they couldn&rsquo;t get
      us, they sat down on their hams and looked up at us so kind of
      disappointed that it was as much as a person could do not to see THEIR
      side of the matter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. IT&rsquo;S A CARAVAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I WAS so weak that the only thing I wanted was a chance to lay down, so I
      made straight for my locker-bunk, and stretched myself out there. But a
      body couldn&rsquo;t get back his strength in no such oven as that, so Tom give
      the command to soar, and Jim started her aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had to go up a mile before we struck comfortable weather where it was
      breezy and pleasant and just right, and pretty soon I was all straight
      again. Tom had been setting quiet and thinking; but now he jumps up and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you a thousand to one I know where we are. We&rsquo;re in the Great
      Sahara, as sure as guns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so excited he couldn&rsquo;t hold still; but I wasn&rsquo;t. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, where&rsquo;s the Great Sahara? In England or in Scotland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t in either; it&rsquo;s in Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim&rsquo;s eyes bugged out, and he begun to stare down with no end of interest,
      because that was where his originals come from; but I didn&rsquo;t more than
      half believe it. I couldn&rsquo;t, you know; it seemed too awful far away for us
      to have traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom was full of his discovery, as he called it, and said the lions and
      the sand meant the Great Desert, sure. He said he could &rsquo;a&rsquo; found out,
      before we sighted land, that we was crowding the land somewheres, if he
      had thought of one thing; and when we asked him what, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These clocks. They&rsquo;re chronometers. You always read about them in sea
      voyages. One of them is keeping Grinnage time, and the other is keeping
      St. Louis time, like my watch. When we left St. Louis it was four in the
      afternoon by my watch and this clock, and it was ten at night by this
      Grinnage clock. Well, at this time of the year the sun sets at about seven
      o&rsquo;clock. Now I noticed the time yesterday evening when the sun went down,
      and it was half-past five o&rsquo;clock by the Grinnage clock, and half past 11
      A.M. by my watch and the other clock. You see, the sun rose and set by my
      watch in St. Louis, and the Grinnage clock was six hours fast; but we&rsquo;ve
      come so far east that it comes within less than half an hour of setting by
      the Grinnage clock now, and I&rsquo;m away out&mdash;more than four hours and a
      half out. You see, that meant that we was closing up on the longitude of
      Ireland, and would strike it before long if we was p&rsquo;inted right&mdash;which
      we wasn&rsquo;t. No, sir, we&rsquo;ve been a-wandering&mdash;wandering &rsquo;way down south
      of east, and it&rsquo;s my opinion we are in Africa. Look at this map. You see
      how the shoulder of Africa sticks out to the west. Think how fast we&rsquo;ve
      traveled; if we had gone straight east we would be long past England by
      this time. You watch for noon, all of you, and we&rsquo;ll stand up, and when we
      can&rsquo;t cast a shadow we&rsquo;ll find that this Grinnage clock is coming mighty
      close to marking twelve. Yes, sir, I think we&rsquo;re in Africa; and it&rsquo;s just
      bully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim was gazing down with the glass. He shook his head and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, I reckon dey&rsquo;s a mistake som&rsquo;er&rsquo;s, hain&rsquo;t seen no niggers yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing; they don&rsquo;t live in the desert. What is that, &rsquo;way off
      yonder? Gimme a glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a long look, and said it was like a black string stretched across
      the sand, but he couldn&rsquo;t guess what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I reckon maybe you&rsquo;ve got a chance now to find out
      whereabouts this balloon is, because as like as not that is one of these
      lines here, that&rsquo;s on the map, that you call meridians of longitude, and
      we can drop down and look at its number, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, I never see such a lunkhead as you. Did you s&rsquo;pose
      there&rsquo;s meridians of longitude on the EARTH?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, they&rsquo;re set down on the map, and you know it perfectly well,
      and here they are, and you can see for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re on the map, but that&rsquo;s nothing; there ain&rsquo;t any on the
      GROUND.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, do you know that to be so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, that map&rsquo;s a liar again. I never see such a liar as that
      map.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fired up at that, and I was ready for him, and Jim was warming his
      opinion, too, and next minute we&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; broke loose on another argument, if
      Tom hadn&rsquo;t dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands like a maniac and
      sing out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Camels!&mdash;Camels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I grabbed a glass and Jim, too, and took a look, but I was
      disappointed, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Camels your granny; they&rsquo;re spiders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spiders in a desert, you shad? Spiders walking in a procession? You don&rsquo;t
      ever reflect, Huck Finn, and I reckon you really haven&rsquo;t got anything to
      reflect WITH. Don&rsquo;t you know we&rsquo;re as much as a mile up in the air, and
      that that string of crawlers is two or three miles away? Spiders, good
      land! Spiders as big as a cow? Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to go down and milk one
      of &rsquo;em. But they&rsquo;re camels, just the same. It&rsquo;s a caravan, that&rsquo;s what it
      is, and it&rsquo;s a mile long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s go down and look at it. I don&rsquo;t believe in it, and
      ain&rsquo;t going to till I see it and know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he says, and give the command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we come slanting down into the hot weather, we could see that it was
      camels, sure enough, plodding along, an everlasting string of them, with
      bales strapped to them, and several hundred men in long white robes, and a
      thing like a shawl bound over their heads and hanging down with tassels
      and fringes; and some of the men had long guns and some hadn&rsquo;t, and some
      was riding and some was walking. And the weather&mdash;well, it was just
      roasting. And how slow they did creep along! We swooped down now, all of a
      sudden, and stopped about a hundred yards over their heads.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0073}.jpg" alt="{0073}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0073}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      The men all set up a yell, and some of them fell flat on their stomachs,
      some begun to fire their guns at us, and the rest broke and scampered
      every which way, and so did the camels.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see that we was making trouble, so we went up again about a mile, to
      the cool weather, and watched them from there. It took them an hour to get
      together and form the procession again; then they started along, but we
      could see by the glasses that they wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention to
      anything but us. We poked along, looking down at them with the glasses,
      and by and by we see a big sand mound, and something like people the other
      side of it, and there was something like a man laying on top of the mound
      that raised his head up every now and then, and seemed to be watching the
      caravan or us, we didn&rsquo;t know which. As the caravan got nearer, he sneaked
      down on the other side and rushed to the other men and horses&mdash;for
      that is what they was&mdash;and we see them mount in a hurry; and next,
      here they come, like a house afire, some with lances and some with long
      guns, and all of them yelling the best they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      They come a-tearing down on to the caravan, and the next minute both sides
      crashed together and was all mixed up, and there was such another popping
      of guns as you never heard, and the air got so full of smoke you could
      only catch glimpses of them struggling together. There must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been six
      hundred men in that battle, and it was terrible to see. Then they broke up
      into gangs and groups, fighting tooth and nail, and scurrying and
      scampering around, and laying into each other like everything; and
      whenever the smoke cleared a little you could see dead and wounded people
      and camels scattered far and wide and all about, and camels racing off in
      every direction.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0077}.jpg" alt="{0077}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0077}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      At last the robbers see they couldn&rsquo;t win, so their chief sounded a
      signal, and all that was left of them broke away and went scampering
      across the plain. The last man to go snatched up a child and carried it
      off in front of him on his horse, and a woman run screaming and begging
      after him, and followed him away off across the plain till she was
      separated a long ways from her people; but it warn&rsquo;t no use, and she had
      to give it up, and we see her sink down on the sand and cover her face
      with her hands. Then Tom took the hellum, and started for that yahoo, and
      we come a-whizzing down and made a swoop, and knocked him out of the
      saddle, child and all; and he was jarred considerable, but the child
      wasn&rsquo;t hurt, but laid there working its hands and legs in the air like a
      tumble-bug that&rsquo;s on its back and can&rsquo;t turn over. The man went staggering
      off to overtake his horse, and didn&rsquo;t know what had hit him, for we was
      three or four hundred yards up in the air by this time.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0081}.jpg" alt="{0081}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0081}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We judged the woman would go and get the child now; but she didn&rsquo;t. We
      could see her, through the glass, still setting there, with her head bowed
      down on her knees; so of course she hadn&rsquo;t seen the performance, and
      thought her child was clean gone with the man. She was nearly a half a
      mile from her people, so we thought we might go down to the child, which
      was about a quarter of a mile beyond her, and snake it to her before the
      caravan people could git to us to do us any harm; and besides, we reckoned
      they had enough business on their hands for one while, anyway, with the
      wounded. We thought we&rsquo;d chance it, and we did. We swooped down and
      stopped, and Jim shinned down the ladder and fetched up the kid, which was
      a nice fat little thing, and in a noble good humor, too, considering it
      was just out of a battle and been tumbled off of a horse; and then we
      started for the mother, and stopped back of her and tolerable near by, and
      Jim slipped down and crept up easy, and when he was close back of her the
      child goo-goo&rsquo;d, the way a child does, and she heard it, and whirled and
      fetched a shriek of joy, and made a jump for the kid and snatched it and
      hugged it, and dropped it and hugged Jim, and then snatched off a gold
      chain and hung it around Jim&rsquo;s neck, and hugged him again, and jerked up
      the child again, a-sobbing and glorifying all the time; and Jim he shoved
      for the ladder and up it, and in a minute we was back up in the sky and
      the woman was staring up, with the back of her head between her shoulders
      and the child with its arms locked around her neck. And there she stood,
      as long as we was in sight a-sailing away in the sky.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. TOM RESPECTS THE FLEA
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOON!&rdquo; says Tom, and so it was. His shadder was just a blot around his
      feet. We looked, and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the
      difference didn&rsquo;t amount to nothing. So Tom said London was right north of
      us or right south of us, one or t&rsquo;other, and he reckoned by the weather
      and the sand and the camels it was north; and a good many miles north,
      too; as many as from New York to the city of Mexico, he guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in the
      world, unless it might be some kinds of birds&mdash;a wild pigeon, maybe,
      or a railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom said he had read about railroads in England going nearly a hundred
      miles an hour for a little ways, and there never was a bird in the world
      that could do that&mdash;except one, and that was a flea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A flea? Why, Mars Tom, in de fust place he ain&rsquo;t a bird, strickly
      speakin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t a bird, eh? Well, then, what is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know, Mars Tom, but I speck he&rsquo;s only jist a&rsquo; animal. No,
      I reckon dat won&rsquo;t do, nuther, he ain&rsquo;t big enough for a&rsquo; animal. He mus&rsquo;
      be a bug. Yassir, dat&rsquo;s what he is, he&rsquo;s a bug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet he ain&rsquo;t, but let it go. What&rsquo;s your second place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in de second place, birds is creturs dat goes a long ways, but a
      flea don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t he? Come, now, what IS a long distance, if you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s miles, and lots of &rsquo;em&mdash;anybody knows dat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a man walk miles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yassir, he kin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As many as a railroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yassir, if you give him time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a flea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose so&mdash;ef you gives him heaps of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you begin to see, don&rsquo;t you, that DISTANCE ain&rsquo;t the thing to judge
      by, at all; it&rsquo;s the time it takes to go the distance IN that COUNTS,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hit do look sorter so, but I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieved it, Mars Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0085}.jpg" alt="{0085}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0085}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of PROPORTION, that&rsquo;s what it is; and when you come to
      gauge a thing&rsquo;s speed by its size, where&rsquo;s your bird and your man and your
      railroad, alongside of a flea? The fastest man can&rsquo;t run more than about
      ten miles in an hour&mdash;not much over ten thousand times his own
      length. But all the books says any common ordinary third-class flea can
      jump a hundred and fifty times his own length; yes, and he can make five
      jumps a second too&mdash;seven hundred and fifty times his own length, in
      one little second&mdash;for he don&rsquo;t fool away any time stopping and
      starting&mdash;he does them both at the same time; you&rsquo;ll see, if you try
      to put your finger on him. Now that&rsquo;s a common, ordinary, third-class
      flea&rsquo;s gait; but you take an Eyetalian FIRST-class, that&rsquo;s been the pet of
      the nobility all his life, and hasn&rsquo;t ever knowed what want or sickness or
      exposure was, and he can jump more than three hundred times his own
      length, and keep it up all day, five such jumps every second, which is
      fifteen hundred times his own length. Well, suppose a man could go fifteen
      hundred times his own length in a second&mdash;say, a mile and a half.
      It&rsquo;s ninety miles a minute; it&rsquo;s considerable more than five thousand
      miles an hour. Where&rsquo;s your man NOW?&mdash;yes, and your bird, and your
      railroad, and your balloon? Laws, they don&rsquo;t amount to shucks &rsquo;longside of
      a flea. A flea is just a comet b&rsquo;iled down small.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Jim was a good deal astonished, and so was I. Jim said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is dem figgers jist edjackly true, en no jokin&rsquo; en no lies, Mars Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are; they&rsquo;re perfectly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, den, honey, a body&rsquo;s got to respec&rsquo; a flea. I ain&rsquo;t had no respec&rsquo;
      for um befo&rsquo;, sca&rsquo;sely, but dey ain&rsquo;t no gittin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; it, dey do deserve
      it, dat&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I bet they do. They&rsquo;ve got ever so much more sense, and brains, and
      brightness, in proportion to their size, than any other cretur in the
      world. A person can learn them &rsquo;most anything; and they learn it quicker
      than any other cretur, too. They&rsquo;ve been learnt to haul little carriages
      in harness, and go this way and that way and t&rsquo;other way according to
      their orders; yes, and to march and drill like soldiers, doing it as
      exact, according to orders, as soldiers does it. They&rsquo;ve been learnt to do
      all sorts of hard and troublesome things. S&rsquo;pose you could cultivate a
      flea up to the size of a man, and keep his natural smartness a-growing and
      a-growing right along up, bigger and bigger, and keener and keener, in the
      same proportion&mdash;where&rsquo;d the human race be, do you reckon? That flea
      would be President of the United States, and you couldn&rsquo;t any more prevent
      it than you can prevent lightning.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;My lan&rsquo;, Mars Tom, I never knowed dey was so much TO de beas&rsquo;. No, sir, I
      never had no idea of it, and dat&rsquo;s de fac&rsquo;.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to him, by a long sight, than there is to any other cretur,
      man or beast, in proportion to size. He&rsquo;s the interestingest of them all.
      People have so much to say about an ant&rsquo;s strength, and an elephant&rsquo;s, and
      a locomotive&rsquo;s. Shucks, they don&rsquo;t begin with a flea. He can lift two or
      three hundred times his own weight. And none of them can come anywhere
      near it. And, moreover, he has got notions of his own, and is very
      particular, and you can&rsquo;t fool him; his instinct, or his judgment, or
      whatever it is, is perfectly sound and clear, and don&rsquo;t ever make a
      mistake. People think all humans are alike to a flea. It ain&rsquo;t so. There&rsquo;s
      folks that he won&rsquo;t go near, hungry or not hungry, and I&rsquo;m one of them.
      I&rsquo;ve never had one of them on me in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so; I ain&rsquo;t joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sah, I hain&rsquo;t ever heard de likes o&rsquo; dat befo&rsquo;.&rdquo; Jim couldn&rsquo;t
      believe it, and I couldn&rsquo;t; so we had to drop down to the sand and git a
      supply and see. Tom was right. They went for me and Jim by the thousand,
      but not a one of them lit on Tom. There warn&rsquo;t no explaining it, but there
      it was and there warn&rsquo;t no getting around it. He said it had always been
      just so, and he&rsquo;d just as soon be where there was a million of them as
      not; they&rsquo;d never touch him nor bother him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went up to the cold weather to freeze &rsquo;em out, and stayed a little
      spell, and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazying
      along twenty or twenty-five miles an hour, the way we&rsquo;d been doing for the
      last few hours. The reason was, that the longer we was in that solemn,
      peaceful desert, the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down in
      us, and the more happier and contented and satisfied we got to feeling,
      and the more we got to liking the desert, and then loving it. So we had
      cramped the speed down, as I was saying, and was having a most noble good
      lazy time, sometimes watching through the glasses, sometimes stretched out
      on the lockers reading, sometimes taking a nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn&rsquo;t seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to find
      land and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that&mdash;clean over
      it. We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and didn&rsquo;t
      want to be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it &rsquo;most seemed
      as if I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the same. And
      always I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging at me, and pestering
      of me, and scolding, and finding fault, and fussing and bothering, and
      sticking to me, and keeping after me, and making me do this, and making me
      do that and t&rsquo;other, and always selecting out the things I didn&rsquo;t want to
      do, and then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else,
      and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time; but up here in
      the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely, and plenty to eat, and
      plenty of sleep, and strange things to see, and no nagging and no
      pestering, and no good people, and just holiday all the time. Land, I
      warn&rsquo;t in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again. Now, one of
      the worst things about civilization is, that anybody that gits a letter
      with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes you feel
      bad, and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the
      world, and keeps you downhearted and dismal &rsquo;most all the time, and it&rsquo;s
      such a heavy load for a person. I hate them newspapers; and I hate
      letters; and if I had my way I wouldn&rsquo;t allow nobody to load his troubles
      on to other folks he ain&rsquo;t acquainted with, on t&rsquo;other side of the world,
      that way. Well, up in a balloon there ain&rsquo;t any of that, and it&rsquo;s the
      darlingest place there is.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had supper, and that night was one of the prettiest nights I ever see.
      The moon made it just like daylight, only a heap softer; and once we see a
      lion standing all alone by himself, just all alone on the earth, it seemed
      like, and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a puddle of ink. That&rsquo;s
      the kind of moonlight to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mainly we laid on our backs and talked; we didn&rsquo;t want to go to sleep. Tom
      said we was right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now. He said it was
      right along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened; so
      we looked down and watched while he told about it, because there ain&rsquo;t
      anything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book has
      talked about. It was a tale about a camel-driver that had lost his camel,
      and he come along in the desert and met a man, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you run across a stray camel to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the man says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he blind in his left eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he lost an upper front tooth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was his off hind leg lame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he loaded with millet-seed on one side and honey on the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you needn&rsquo;t go into no more details&mdash;that&rsquo;s the one, and
      I&rsquo;m in a hurry. Where did you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t seen him at all,&rdquo; the man says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t seen him at all? How can you describe him so close, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because when a person knows how to use his eyes, everything has got a
      meaning to it; but most people&rsquo;s eyes ain&rsquo;t any good to them. I knowed a
      camel had been along, because I seen his track. I knowed he was lame in
      his off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on it,
      and his track showed it. I knowed he was blind on his left side because he
      only nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail. I knowed he had
      lost an upper front tooth because where he bit into the sod his
      teeth-print showed it. The millet-seed sifted out on one side&mdash;the
      ants told me that; the honey leaked out on the other&mdash;the flies told
      me that. I know all about your camel, but I hain&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Mars Tom, hit&rsquo;s a mighty good tale, and powerful interestin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Tom says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ALL?&rdquo; says Jim, astonished. &ldquo;What &rsquo;come o&rsquo; de camel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, don&rsquo;t de tale say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim puzzled a minute, then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Ef dat ain&rsquo;t de beatenes&rsquo; tale ever I struck. Jist gits to de place
      whah de intrust is gittin&rsquo; red-hot, en down she breaks. Why, Mars Tom, dey
      ain&rsquo;t no SENSE in a tale dat acts like dat. Hain&rsquo;t you got no IDEA whether
      de man got de camel back er not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I see myself there warn&rsquo;t no sense in the tale, to chop square off that
      way before it come to anything, but I warn&rsquo;t going to say so, because I
      could see Tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out and
      the way Jim had popped on to the weak place in it, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
      fair for everybody to pile on to a feller when he&rsquo;s down. But Tom he
      whirls on me and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do YOU think of the tale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, then, I had to come out and make a clean breast and say it did
      seem to me, too, same as it did to Jim, that as long as the tale stopped
      square in the middle and never got to no place, it really warn&rsquo;t worth the
      trouble of telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s chin dropped on his breast, and &rsquo;stead of being mad, as I reckoned
      he&rsquo;d be, to hear me scoff at his tale that way, he seemed to be only sad;
      and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people can see, and some can&rsquo;t&mdash;just as that man said. Let
      alone a camel, if a cyclone had gone by, YOU duffers wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; noticed
      the track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know what he meant by that, and he didn&rsquo;t say; it was just one of
      his irrulevances, I reckon&mdash;he was full of them, sometimes, when he
      was in a close place and couldn&rsquo;t see no other way out&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t
      mind. We&rsquo;d spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough, he couldn&rsquo;t
      git away from that little fact. It graveled him like the nation, too, I
      reckon, much as he tried not to let on.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE DISAPPEARING LAKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE had an early breakfast in the morning, and set looking down on the
      desert, and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely, although we warn&rsquo;t
      high up. You have to come down lower and lower after sundown in the
      desert, because it cools off so fast; and so, by the time it is getting
      toward dawn, you are skimming along only a little ways above the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground, and now
      and then gazing off across the desert to see if anything was stirring, and
      then down on the shadder again, when all of a sudden almost right under us
      we see a lot of men and camels laying scattered about, perfectly quiet,
      like they was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shut off the power, and backed up and stood over them, and then we see
      that they was all dead. It give us the cold shivers. And it made us hush
      down, too, and talk low, like people at a funeral. We dropped down slow
      and stopped, and me and Tom clumb down and went among them. There was men,
      and women, and children. They was dried by the sun and dark and shriveled
      and leathery, like the pictures of mummies you see in books. And yet they
      looked just as human, you wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; believed it; just like they was
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the people and animals was partly covered with sand, but most of
      them not, for the sand was thin there, and the bed was gravel and hard.
      Most of the clothes had rotted away; and when you took hold of a rag, it
      tore with a touch, like spiderweb. Tom reckoned they had been laying there
      for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the men had rusty guns by them, some had swords on and had shawl
      belts with long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them. All the camels had
      their loads on yet, but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the
      freight out on the ground. We didn&rsquo;t reckon the swords was any good to the
      dead people any more, so we took one apiece, and some pistols. We took a
      small box, too, because it was so handsome and inlaid so fine; and then we
      wanted to bury the people; but there warn&rsquo;t no way to do it that we could
      think of, and nothing to do it with but sand, and that would blow away
      again, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we mounted high and sailed away, and pretty soon that black spot on
      the sand was out of sight, and we wouldn&rsquo;t ever see them poor people again
      in this world. We wondered, and reasoned, and tried to guess how they come
      to be there, and how it all happened to them, but we couldn&rsquo;t make it out.
      First we thought maybe they got lost, and wandered around and about till
      their food and water give out and they starved to death; but Tom said no
      wild animals nor vultures hadn&rsquo;t meddled with them, and so that guess
      wouldn&rsquo;t do. So at last we give it up, and judged we wouldn&rsquo;t think about
      it no more, because it made us low-spirited.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0101}.jpg" alt="{0101}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0101}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Then we opened the box, and it had gems and jewels in it, quite a pile,
      and some little veils of the kind the dead women had on, with fringes made
      out of curious gold money that we warn&rsquo;t acquainted with. We wondered if
      we better go and try to find them again and give it back; but Tom thought
      it over and said no, it was a country that was full of robbers, and they
      would come and steal it; and then the sin would be on us for putting the
      temptation in their way. So we went on; but I wished we had took all they
      had, so there wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been no temptation at all left.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had had two hours of that blazing weather down there, and was dreadful
      thirsty when we got aboard again. We went straight for the water, but it
      was spoiled and bitter, besides being pretty near hot enough to scald your
      mouth. We couldn&rsquo;t drink it. It was Mississippi river water, the best in
      the world, and we stirred up the mud in it to see if that would help, but
      no, the mud wasn&rsquo;t any better than the water. Well, we hadn&rsquo;t been so
      very, very thirsty before, while we was interested in the lost people, but
      we was now, and as soon as we found we couldn&rsquo;t have a drink, we was more
      than thirty-five times as thirsty as we was a quarter of a minute before.
      Why, in a little while we wanted to hold our mouths open and pant like a
      dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom said to keep a sharp lookout, all around, everywheres, because we&rsquo;d
      got to find an oasis or there warn&rsquo;t no telling what would happen. So we
      done it. We kept the glasses gliding around all the time, till our arms
      got so tired we couldn&rsquo;t hold them any more. Two hours&mdash;three hours&mdash;just
      gazing and gazing, and nothing but sand, sand, SAND, and you could see the
      quivering heat-shimmer playing over it. Dear, dear, a body don&rsquo;t know what
      real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and is certain he
      ain&rsquo;t ever going to come to any water any more. At last I couldn&rsquo;t stand
      it to look around on them baking plains; I laid down on the locker, and
      give it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by and by Tom raised a whoop, and there she was! A lake, wide and
      shiny, with pa&rsquo;m-trees leaning over it asleep, and their shadders in the
      water just as soft and delicate as ever you see. I never see anything look
      so good. It was a long ways off, but that warn&rsquo;t anything to us; we just
      slapped on a hundred-mile gait, and calculated to be there in seven
      minutes; but she stayed the same old distance away, all the time; we
      couldn&rsquo;t seem to gain on her; yes, sir, just as far, and shiny, and like a
      dream; but we couldn&rsquo;t get no nearer; and at last, all of a sudden, she
      was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s eyes took a spread, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, it was a MYridge!&rdquo; Said it like he was glad. I didn&rsquo;t see nothing
      to be glad about. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. I don&rsquo;t care nothing about its name, the thing I want to know is,
      what&rsquo;s become of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim was trembling all over, and so scared he couldn&rsquo;t speak, but he wanted
      to ask that question himself if he could &rsquo;a&rsquo; done it. Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s BECOME of it? Why, you see yourself it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; but where&rsquo;s it gone TO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked me over and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, Huck Finn, where WOULD it go to! Don&rsquo;t you know what a myridge
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t anything but imagination. There ain&rsquo;t anything TO it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that, and I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use you talking that kind of stuff, Tom Sawyer? Didn&rsquo;t I see
      the lake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you think you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think nothing about it, I DID see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you you DIDN&rsquo;T see it either&mdash;because it warn&rsquo;t there to
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It astonished Jim to hear him talk so, and he broke in and says, kind of
      pleading and distressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, PLEASE don&rsquo;t say sich things in sich an awful time as dis. You
      ain&rsquo;t only reskin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; own self, but you&rsquo;s reskin&rsquo; us&mdash;same way like
      Anna Nias en Siffra. De lake WUZ dah&mdash;I seen it jis&rsquo; as plain as I
      sees you en Huck dis minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he seen it himself! He was the very one that seen it first. NOW,
      then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mars Tom, hit&rsquo;s so&mdash;you can&rsquo;t deny it. We all seen it, en dat
      PROVE it was dah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proves it! How does it prove it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same way it does in de courts en everywheres, Mars Tom. One pusson might
      be drunk, or dreamy or suthin&rsquo;, en he could be mistaken; en two might,
      maybe; but I tell you, sah, when three sees a thing, drunk er sober, it&rsquo;s
      SO. Dey ain&rsquo;t no gittin&rsquo; aroun&rsquo; dat, en you knows it, Mars Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing of the kind. There used to be forty thousand million
      people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to the other every
      day. Did that prove that the sun DONE it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course it did. En besides, dey warn&rsquo;t no &rsquo;casion to prove it. A body
      &rsquo;at&rsquo;s got any sense ain&rsquo;t gwine to doubt it. Dah she is now&mdash;a
      sailin&rsquo; thoo de sky, like she allays done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom turned on me, then, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do YOU say&mdash;is the sun standing still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, what&rsquo;s the use to ask such a jackass question? Anybody that
      ain&rsquo;t blind can see it don&rsquo;t stand still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost in the sky with no company but a passel of
      low-down animals that don&rsquo;t know no more than the head boss of a
      university did three or four hundred years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It warn&rsquo;t fair play, and I let him know it. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throwin&rsquo; mud ain&rsquo;t arguin&rsquo;, Tom Sawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness gracious, dah&rsquo;s de lake agi&rsquo;n!&rdquo; yelled
      Jim, just then. &ldquo;NOW, Mars Tom, what you gwine to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sir, there was the lake again, away yonder across the desert,
      perfectly plain, trees and all, just the same as it was before. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;re satisfied now, Tom Sawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he says, perfectly ca&rsquo;m:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, satisfied there ain&rsquo;t no lake there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T talk so, Mars Tom&mdash;it sk&rsquo;yers me to hear you. It&rsquo;s so hot, en
      you&rsquo;s so thirsty, dat you ain&rsquo;t in yo&rsquo; right mine, Mars Tom. Oh, but don&rsquo;t
      she look good! &rsquo;clah I doan&rsquo; know how I&rsquo;s gwine to wait tell we gits dah,
      I&rsquo;s SO thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to wait; and it won&rsquo;t do you no good, either, because
      there ain&rsquo;t no lake there, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, don&rsquo;t you take your eye off of it, and I won&rsquo;t, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Deed I won&rsquo;t; en bless you, honey, I couldn&rsquo;t ef I wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went a-tearing along toward it, piling the miles behind us like
      nothing, but never gaining an inch on it&mdash;and all of a sudden it was
      gone again! Jim staggered, and &rsquo;most fell down. When he got his breath he
      says, gasping like a fish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, hit&rsquo;s a GHOS&rsquo;, dat&rsquo;s what it is, en I hopes to goodness we
      ain&rsquo;t gwine to see it no mo&rsquo;. Dey&rsquo;s BEEN a lake, en suthin&rsquo;s happened, en
      de lake&rsquo;s dead, en we&rsquo;s seen its ghos&rsquo;; we&rsquo;s seen it twiste, en dat&rsquo;s
      proof. De desert&rsquo;s ha&rsquo;nted, it&rsquo;s ha&rsquo;nted, sho; oh, Mars Tom, le&rsquo; &rsquo;s git
      outen it; I&rsquo;d ruther die den have de night ketch us in it ag&rsquo;in en de
      ghos&rsquo; er dat lake come a-mournin&rsquo; aroun&rsquo; us en we asleep en doan&rsquo; know de
      danger we&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghost, you gander! It ain&rsquo;t anything but air and heat and thirstiness
      pasted together by a person&rsquo;s imagination. If I&mdash;gimme the glass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a flock of birds,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting toward sundown, and
      they&rsquo;re making a bee-line across our track for somewheres. They mean
      business&mdash;maybe they&rsquo;re going for food or water, or both. Let her go
      to starboard!&mdash;Port your hellum! Hard down! There&mdash;ease up&mdash;steady,
      as you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shut down some of the power, so as not to outspeed them, and took out
      after them. We went skimming along a quarter of a mile behind them, and
      when we had followed them an hour and a half and was getting pretty
      discouraged, and was thirsty clean to unendurableness, Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the glass, one of you, and see what that is, away ahead of the
      birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim got the first glimpse, and slumped down on the locker sick. He was
      most crying, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dah ag&rsquo;in, Mars Tom, she&rsquo;s dah ag&rsquo;in, en I knows I&rsquo;s gwine to die,
      &rsquo;case when a body sees a ghos&rsquo; de third time, dat&rsquo;s what it means. I wisht
      I&rsquo;d never come in dis balloon, dat I does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wouldn&rsquo;t look no more, and what he said made me afraid, too, because I
      knowed it was true, for that has always been the way with ghosts; so then
      I wouldn&rsquo;t look any more, either. Both of us begged Tom to turn off and go
      some other way, but he wouldn&rsquo;t, and said we was ignorant superstitious
      blatherskites. Yes, and he&rsquo;ll git come up with, one of these days, I says
      to myself, insulting ghosts that way. They&rsquo;ll stand it for a while, maybe,
      but they won&rsquo;t stand it always, for anybody that knows about ghosts knows
      how easy they are hurt, and how revengeful they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we was all quiet and still, Jim and me being scared, and Tom busy. By
      and by Tom fetched the balloon to a standstill, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOW get up and look, you sapheads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We done it, and there was the sure-enough water right under us!&mdash;clear,
      and blue, and cool, and deep, and wavy with the breeze, the loveliest
      sight that ever was. And all about it was grassy banks, and flowers, and
      shady groves of big trees, looped together with vines, and all looking so
      peaceful and comfortable&mdash;enough to make a body cry, it was so
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim DID cry, and rip and dance and carry on, he was so thankful and out of
      his mind for joy. It was my watch, so I had to stay by the works, but Tom
      and Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece, and fetched me up a lot, and
      I&rsquo;ve tasted a many a good thing in my life, but nothing that ever begun
      with that water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we went down and had a swim, and then Tom came up and spelled me, and
      me and Jim had a swim, and then Jim spelled Tom, and me and Tom had a
      foot-race and a boxing-mill, and I don&rsquo;t reckon I ever had such a good
      time in my life. It warn&rsquo;t so very hot, because it was close on to
      evening, and we hadn&rsquo;t any clothes on, anyway. Clothes is well enough in
      school, and in towns, and at balls, too, but there ain&rsquo;t no sense in them
      when there ain&rsquo;t no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and fussiness
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lions a-comin&rsquo;!&mdash;lions! Quick, Mars Tom! Jump for yo&rsquo; life, Huck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and didn&rsquo;t we! We never stopped for clothes, but waltzed up the ladder
      just so. Jim lost his head straight off&mdash;he always done it whenever
      he got excited and scared; and so now, &rsquo;stead of just easing the ladder up
      from the ground a little, so the animals couldn&rsquo;t reach it, he turned on a
      raft of power, and we went whizzing up and was dangling in the sky before
      he got his wits together and seen what a foolish thing he was doing. Then
      he stopped her, but he had clean forgot what to do next; so there we was,
      so high that the lions looked like pups, and we was drifting off on the
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her down,
      and back toward the lake, where the animals was gathering like a
      camp-meeting, and I judged he had lost HIS head, too; for he knowed I was
      too scared to climb, and did he want to dump me among the tigers and
      things?
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, his head was level, he knowed what he was about. He swooped down
      to within thirty or forty feet of the lake, and stopped right over the
      center, and sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leggo, and drop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I done it, and shot down, feet first, and seemed to go about a mile toward
      the bottom; and when I come up, he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now lay on your back and float till you&rsquo;re rested and got your pluck
      back, then I&rsquo;ll dip the ladder in the water and you can climb aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I done it. Now that was ever so smart in Tom, because if he had started
      off somewheres else to drop down on the sand, the menagerie would &rsquo;a&rsquo; come
      along, too, and might &rsquo;a&rsquo; kept us hunting a safe place till I got tuckered
      out and fell.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0109}.jpg" alt="{0109}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0109}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      And all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes, and
      trying to divide them up so there would be some for all, but there was a
      misunderstanding about it somewheres, on account of some of them trying to
      hog more than their share; so there was another insurrection, and you
      never see anything like it in the world. There must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been fifty of
      them, all mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping and biting
      and tearing, legs and tails in the air, and you couldn&rsquo;t tell which was
      which, and the sand and fur a-flying. And when they got done, some was
      dead and some was limping off crippled, and the rest was setting around on
      the battlefield, some of them licking their sore places and the others
      looking up at us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down and
      have some fun, but which we didn&rsquo;t want any.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the clothes, they warn&rsquo;t any, any more. Every last rag of them was
      inside of the animals; and not agreeing with them very well, I don&rsquo;t
      reckon, for there was considerable many brass buttons on them, and there
      was knives in the pockets, too, and smoking tobacco, and nails and chalk
      and marbles and fishhooks and things. But I wasn&rsquo;t caring. All that was
      bothering me was, that all we had now was the professor&rsquo;s clothes, a big
      enough assortment, but not suitable to go into company with, if we came
      across any, because the britches was as long as tunnels, and the coats and
      things according. Still, there was everything a tailor needed, and Jim was
      a kind of jack legged tailor, and he allowed he could soon trim a suit or
      two down for us that would answer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. TOM DISCOURSES ON THE DESERT
    </h2>
    <p>
      STILL, we thought we would drop down there a minute, but on another
      errand. Most of the professor&rsquo;s cargo of food was put up in cans, in the
      new way that somebody had just invented; the rest was fresh. When you
      fetch Missouri beefsteak to the Great Sahara, you want to be particular
      and stay up in the coolish weather. So we reckoned we would drop down into
      the lion market and see how we could make out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the reach
      of the animals, then we let down a rope with a slip-knot in it and hauled
      up a dead lion, a small tender one, then yanked up a cub tiger. We had to
      keep the congregation off with the revolver, or they would &rsquo;a&rsquo; took a hand
      in the proceedings and helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      We carved off a supply from both, and saved the skins, and hove the rest
      overboard. Then we baited some of the professor&rsquo;s hooks with the fresh
      meat and went a-fishing. We stood over the lake just a convenient distance
      above the water, and catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever see. It was
      a most amazing good supper we had; lion steak, tiger steak, fried fish,
      and hot corn-pone. I don&rsquo;t want nothing better than that.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0006}.jpg" alt="{0006}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0006}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We had some fruit to finish off with. We got it out of the top of a
      monstrous tall tree. It was a very slim tree that hadn&rsquo;t a branch on it
      from the bottom plumb to the top, and there it bursted out like a
      feather-duster. It was a pa&rsquo;m-tree, of course; anybody knows a pa&rsquo;m-tree
      the minute he see it, by the pictures. We went for cocoanuts in this one,
      but there warn&rsquo;t none. There was only big loose bunches of things like
      oversized grapes, and Tom allowed they was dates, because he said they
      answered the description in the Arabian Nights and the other books. Of
      course they mightn&rsquo;t be, and they might be poison; so we had to wait a
      spell, and watch and see if the birds et them. They done it; so we done
      it, too, and they was most amazing good.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the dead
      animals. They was plucky creturs; they would tackle one end of a lion that
      was being gnawed at the other end by another lion. If the lion drove the
      bird away, it didn&rsquo;t do no good; he was back again the minute the lion was
      busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big birds come out of every part of the sky&mdash;you could make them
      out with the glass while they was still so far away you couldn&rsquo;t see them
      with your naked eye. Tom said the birds didn&rsquo;t find out the meat was there
      by the smell; they had to find it out by seeing it. Oh, but ain&rsquo;t that an
      eye for you! Tom said at the distance of five mile a patch of dead lions
      couldn&rsquo;t look any bigger than a person&rsquo;s finger-nail, and he couldn&rsquo;t
      imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion, and we thought maybe
      they warn&rsquo;t kin. But Jim said that didn&rsquo;t make no difference. He said a
      hog was fond of her own children, and so was a spider, and he reckoned
      maybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite. He
      thought likely a lion wouldn&rsquo;t eat his own father, if he knowed which was
      him, but reckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if he was uncommon
      hungry, and eat his mother-in-law any time. But RECKONING don&rsquo;t settle
      nothing. You can reckon till the cows come home, but that don&rsquo;t fetch you
      to no decision. So we give it up and let it drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generly it was very still in the Desert nights, but this time there was
      music. A lot of other animals come to dinner; sneaking yelpers that Tom
      allowed was jackals, and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas; and
      all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time. They made a
      picture in the moonlight that was more different than any picture I ever
      see. We had a line out and made fast to the top of a tree, and didn&rsquo;t
      stand no watch, but all turned in and slept; but I was up two or three
      times to look down at the animals and hear the music. It was like having a
      front seat at a menagerie for nothing, which I hadn&rsquo;t ever had before, and
      so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make the most of it; I mightn&rsquo;t ever
      have such a chance again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went a-fishing again in the early dawn, and then lazied around all day
      in the deep shade on an island, taking turn about to watch and see that
      none of the animals come a-snooping around there after erronorts for
      dinner. We was going to leave the next day, but couldn&rsquo;t, it was too
      lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after, when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward, we
      looked back and watched that place till it warn&rsquo;t nothing but just a speck
      in the Desert, and I tell you it was like saying good-bye to a friend that
      you ain&rsquo;t ever going to see any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim was thinking to himself, and at last he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, we&rsquo;s mos&rsquo; to de end er de Desert now, I speck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hit stan&rsquo; to reason we is. You knows how long we&rsquo;s been a-skimmin&rsquo;
      over it. Mus&rsquo; be mos&rsquo; out o&rsquo; san&rsquo;. Hit&rsquo;s a wonder to me dat it&rsquo;s hilt out
      as long as it has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, there&rsquo;s plenty sand, you needn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t a-worryin&rsquo;, Mars Tom, only wonderin&rsquo;, dat&rsquo;s all. De Lord&rsquo;s
      got plenty san&rsquo;, I ain&rsquo;t doubtin&rsquo; dat; but nemmine, He ain&rsquo;t gwyne to
      WAS&rsquo;E it jist on dat account; en I allows dat dis Desert&rsquo;s plenty big
      enough now, jist de way she is, en you can&rsquo;t spread her out no mo&rsquo; &rsquo;dout
      was&rsquo;in&rsquo; san&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go &rsquo;long! we ain&rsquo;t much more than fairly STARTED across this Desert
      yet. The United States is a pretty big country, ain&rsquo;t it? Ain&rsquo;t it, Huck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t no bigger one, I don&rsquo;t reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;this Desert is about the shape of the United States, and
      if you was to lay it down on top of the United States, it would cover the
      land of the free out of sight like a blanket. There&rsquo;d be a little corner
      sticking out, up at Maine and away up northwest, and Florida sticking out
      like a turtle&rsquo;s tail, and that&rsquo;s all. We&rsquo;ve took California away from the
      Mexicans two or three years ago, so that part of the Pacific coast is ours
      now, and if you laid the Great Sahara down with her edge on the Pacific,
      she would cover the United States and stick out past New York six hundred
      miles into the Atlantic ocean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good land! have you got the documents for that, Tom Sawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;re right here, and I&rsquo;ve been studying them. You can look
      for yourself. From New York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles. From one end of
      the Great Desert to the other is 3,200. The United States contains
      3,600,000 square miles, the Desert contains 4,162,000. With the Desert&rsquo;s
      bulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States, and in under
      where the edges projected out, you could tuck England, Scotland, Ireland,
      France, Denmark, and all Germany. Yes, sir, you could hide the home of the
      brave and all of them countries clean out of sight under the Great Sahara,
      and you would still have 2,000 square miles of sand left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;it clean beats me. Why, Tom, it shows that the Lord took
      as much pains makin&rsquo; this Desert as makin&rsquo; the United States and all them
      other countries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim says: &ldquo;Huck, dat don&rsquo; stan&rsquo; to reason. I reckon dis Desert wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t made
      at all. Now you take en look at it like dis&mdash;you look at it, and see
      ef I&rsquo;s right. What&rsquo;s a desert good for? &rsquo;Taint good for nuthin&rsquo;. Dey ain&rsquo;t
      no way to make it pay. Hain&rsquo;t dat so, Huck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t it so, Mars Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef a thing ain&rsquo;t no good, it&rsquo;s made in vain, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOW, den! Do de Lord make anything in vain? You answer me dat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;no, He don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Den how come He make a desert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on. How DID He come to make it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, I b&rsquo;lieve it uz jes like when you&rsquo;s buildin&rsquo; a house; dey&rsquo;s
      allays a lot o&rsquo; truck en rubbish lef&rsquo; over. What does you do wid it? Doan&rsquo;
      you take en k&rsquo;yart it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot? &rsquo;Course.
      Now, den, it&rsquo;s my opinion hit was jes like dat&mdash;dat de Great Sahara
      warn&rsquo;t made at all, she jes HAPPEN&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said it was a real good argument, and I believed it was the best one Jim
      ever made. Tom he said the same, but said the trouble about arguments is,
      they ain&rsquo;t nothing but THEORIES, after all, and theories don&rsquo;t prove
      nothing, they only give you a place to rest on, a spell, when you are
      tuckered out butting around and around trying to find out something there
      ain&rsquo;t no way TO find out. And he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another trouble about theories: there&rsquo;s always a hole in them
      somewheres, sure, if you look close enough. It&rsquo;s just so with this one of
      Jim&rsquo;s. Look what billions and billions of stars there is. How does it come
      that there was just exactly enough star-stuff, and none left over? How
      does it come there ain&rsquo;t no sand-pile up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jim was fixed for him and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s de Milky Way?&mdash;dat&rsquo;s what I want to know. What&rsquo;s de Milky
      Way? Answer me dat!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
In my opinion it was just a sockdologer. It&rsquo;s only an opinion, it&rsquo;s
only MY opinion and others may think different; but I said it then and I
stand to it now&mdash;it was a sockdologer. And moreover, besides, it landed
Tom Sawyer. He couldn&rsquo;t say a word. He had that stunned look of a person
that&rsquo;s been shot in the back with a kag of nails. All he said was,
as for people like me and Jim, he&rsquo;d just as soon have intellectual
intercourse with a catfish. But anybody can say that&mdash;and I notice they
always do, when somebody has fetched them a lifter. Tom Sawyer was tired
of that end of the subject.

  So we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again, and the
more we compared it with this and that and t&rsquo;other thing, the more
nobler and bigger and grander it got to look right along. And so,
hunting among the figgers, Tom found, by and by, that it was just the
same size as the Empire of China. Then he showed us the spread the
Empire of China made on the map, and the room she took up in the world.
Well, it was wonderful to think of, and I says:
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve heard talk about this Desert plenty of times, but I never
      knowed before how important she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Important! Sahara important! That&rsquo;s just the way with some people. If a
      thing&rsquo;s big, it&rsquo;s important. That&rsquo;s all the sense they&rsquo;ve got. All they
      can see is SIZE. Why, look at England. It&rsquo;s the most important country in
      the world; and yet you could put it in China&rsquo;s vest-pocket; and not only
      that, but you&rsquo;d have the dickens&rsquo;s own time to find it again the next time
      you wanted it. And look at Russia. It spreads all around and everywhere,
      and yet ain&rsquo;t no more important in this world than Rhode Island is, and
      hasn&rsquo;t got half as much in it that&rsquo;s worth saving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away off now we see a little hill, a-standing up just on the edge of the
      world. Tom broke off his talk, and reached for a glass very much excited,
      and took a look, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;it&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve been looking for, sure. If I&rsquo;m right,
      it&rsquo;s the one the dervish took the man into and showed him all the
      treasures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we begun to gaze, and he begun to tell about it out of the Arabian
      Nights.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE TREASURE-HILL
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TOM said it happened like this.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A dervish was stumping it along through the Desert, on foot, one blazing
      hot day, and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor, and hungry,
      and ornery and tired, and along about where we are now he run across a
      camel-driver with a hundred camels, and asked him for some a&rsquo;ms. But the
      cameldriver he asked to be excused. The dervish said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you own these camels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in debt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;me? No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a man that owns a hundred camels and ain&rsquo;t in debt is rich&mdash;and
      not only rich, but very rich. Ain&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The camel-driver owned up that it was so. Then the dervish says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has made you rich, and He has made me poor. He has His reasons, and
      they are wise, blessed be His name. But He has willed that His rich shall
      help His poor, and you have turned away from me, your brother, in my need,
      and He will remember this, and you will lose by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That made the camel-driver feel shaky, but all the same he was born
      hoggish after money and didn&rsquo;t like to let go a cent; so he begun to whine
      and explain, and said times was hard, and although he had took a full
      freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it, he couldn&rsquo;t git no
      return freight, and so he warn&rsquo;t making no great things out of his trip.
      So the dervish starts along again, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, if you want to take the risk; but I reckon you&rsquo;ve made a
      mistake this time, and missed a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course the camel-driver wanted to know what kind of a chance he had
      missed, because maybe there was money in it; so he run after the dervish,
      and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at last the
      dervish gave in, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that hill yonder? Well, in that hill is all the treasures of
      the earth, and I was looking around for a man with a particular good kind
      heart and a noble, generous disposition, because if I could find just that
      man, I&rsquo;ve got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and he could see
      the treasures and get them out.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0121}.jpg" alt="{0121}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0121}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      So then the camel-driver was in a sweat; and he cried, and begged, and
      took on, and went down on his knees, and said he was just that kind of a
      man, and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he wasn&rsquo;t
      ever described so exact before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says the dervish, &ldquo;all right. If we load the hundred camels,
      can I have half of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver was so glad he couldn&rsquo;t hardly hold in, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re shouting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they shook hands on the bargain, and the dervish got out his box and
      rubbed the salve on the driver&rsquo;s right eye, and the hill opened and he
      went in, and there, sure enough, was piles and piles of gold and jewels
      sparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down.
    </p>
    <p>
      So him and the dervish laid into it, and they loaded every camel till he
      couldn&rsquo;t carry no more; then they said good-bye, and each of them started
      off with his fifty. But pretty soon the camel-driver come a-running and
      overtook the dervish and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t in society, you know, and you don&rsquo;t really need all you&rsquo;ve got.
      Won&rsquo;t you be good, and let me have ten of your camels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the dervish says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what you say is reasonable
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he done it, and they separated and the dervish started off again with
      his forty. But pretty soon here comes the camel-driver bawling after him
      again, and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him,
      saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a dervish
      through, because they live very simple, you know, and don&rsquo;t keep house,
      but board around and give their note.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that warn&rsquo;t the end yet. That ornery hound kept coming and coming till
      he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred. Then he was
      satisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn&rsquo;t ever forgit the
      dervish as long as he lived, and nobody hadn&rsquo;t been so good to him before,
      and liberal. So they shook hands good-bye, and separated and started off
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But do you know, it warn&rsquo;t ten minutes till the camel-driver was
      unsatisfied again&mdash;he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties&mdash;and
      he come a-running again. And this time the thing he wanted was to get the
      dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said the dervish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know,&rdquo; says the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t fool me,&rdquo; says the driver. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to keep back
      something from me, you know it mighty well. You know, I reckon, that if I
      had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things that&rsquo;s
      valuable. Come&mdash;please put it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dervish says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t keeping anything back from you. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you what
      would happen if I put it on. You&rsquo;d never see again. You&rsquo;d be stone-blind
      the rest of your days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But do you know that beat wouldn&rsquo;t believe him. No, he begged and begged,
      and whined and cried, till at last the dervish opened his box and told him
      to put it on, if he wanted to. So the man done it, and sure enough he was
      as blind as a bat in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him; and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye&mdash;a man that&rsquo;s blind hain&rsquo;t got no use for jewelry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he cleared out with the hundred camels, and left that man to wander
      around poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the
      Desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim said he&rsquo;d bet it was a lesson to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom says, &ldquo;and like a considerable many lessons a body gets. They
      ain&rsquo;t no account, because the thing don&rsquo;t ever happen the same way again&mdash;and
      can&rsquo;t. The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled his back for
      life, everybody said it would be a lesson to him. What kind of a lesson?
      How was he going to use it? He couldn&rsquo;t climb chimblies no more, and he
      hadn&rsquo;t no more backs to break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All de same, Mars Tom, dey IS sich a thing as learnin&rsquo; by expe&rsquo;ence. De
      Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t denying that a thing&rsquo;s a lesson if it&rsquo;s a thing that can
      happen twice just the same way. There&rsquo;s lots of such things, and THEY
      educate a person, that&rsquo;s what Uncle Abner always said; but there&rsquo;s forty
      MILLION lots of the other kind&mdash;the kind that don&rsquo;t happen the same
      way twice&mdash;and they ain&rsquo;t no real use, they ain&rsquo;t no more instructive
      than the small-pox. When you&rsquo;ve got it, it ain&rsquo;t no good to find out you
      ought to been vaccinated, and it ain&rsquo;t no good to git vaccinated
      afterward, because the small-pox don&rsquo;t come but once. But, on the other
      hand, Uncle Abner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail
      once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that hadn&rsquo;t,
      and said a person that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was
      gitting knowledge that was always going to be useful to him, and warn&rsquo;t
      ever going to grow dim or doubtful. But I can tell you, Jim, Uncle Abner
      was down on them people that&rsquo;s all the time trying to dig a lesson out of
      everything that happens, no matter whether&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jim was asleep. Tom looked kind of ashamed, because you know a person
      always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other
      person is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way. Of
      course he oughtn&rsquo;t to go to sleep, because it&rsquo;s shabby; but the finer a
      person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep, and so when you come
      to look at it it ain&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;s fault in particular; both of them&rsquo;s to
      blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim begun to snore&mdash;soft and blubbery at first, then a long rasp,
      then a stronger one, then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water
      sucking down the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more power to
      it, and some big coughs and snorts flung in, the way a cow does that is
      choking to death; and when the person has got to that point he is at his
      level best, and can wake up a man that is in the next block with a
      dipperful of loddanum in him, but can&rsquo;t wake himself up although all that
      awful noise of his&rsquo;n ain&rsquo;t but three inches from his own ears. And that is
      the curiosest thing in the world, seems to me. But you rake a match to
      light the candle, and that little bit of a noise will fetch him. I wish I
      knowed what was the reason of that, but there don&rsquo;t seem to be no way to
      find out. Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert, and yanking the
      animals out, for miles and miles around, to see what in the nation was
      going on up there; there warn&rsquo;t nobody nor nothing that was as close to
      the noise as HE was, and yet he was the only cretur that wasn&rsquo;t disturbed
      by it. We yelled at him and whooped at him, it never done no good; but the
      first time there come a little wee noise that wasn&rsquo;t of a usual kind it
      woke him up. No, sir, I&rsquo;ve thought it all over, and so has Tom, and there
      ain&rsquo;t no way to find out why a snorer can&rsquo;t hear himself snore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim said he hadn&rsquo;t been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could listen
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom said nobody warn&rsquo;t accusing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That made him look like he wished he hadn&rsquo;t said anything. And he wanted
      to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the
      camel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched in
      something and wants to take it out of somebody else. He let into the
      camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and
      he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with
      him there, too. But Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure. You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good and
      unselfish, but I don&rsquo;t quite see it. He didn&rsquo;t hunt up another poor
      dervish, did he? No, he didn&rsquo;t. If he was so unselfish, why didn&rsquo;t he go
      in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and be
      satisfied? No, sir, the person he was hunting for was a man with a hundred
      camels. He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, he was willin&rsquo; to divide, fair and square; he only struck
      for fifty camels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, he TOLE de man de truck would make him bline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because he knowed the man&rsquo;s character. It was just the kind of a man
      he was hunting for&mdash;a man that never believes in anybody&rsquo;s word or
      anybody&rsquo;s honorableness, because he ain&rsquo;t got none of his own. I reckon
      there&rsquo;s lots of people like that dervish. They swindle, right and left,
      but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself. They keep
      inside of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain&rsquo;t no way to
      git hold of them. THEY don&rsquo;t put the salve on&mdash;oh, no, that would be
      sin; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on, then it&rsquo;s you that
      blinds yourself. I reckon the dervish and the camel-driver was just a pair&mdash;a
      fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull, coarse, ignorant one, but both of
      them rascals, just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, does you reckon dey&rsquo;s any o&rsquo; dat kind o&rsquo; salve in de worl&rsquo;
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Abner says there is. He says they&rsquo;ve got it in New York, and
      they put it on country people&rsquo;s eyes and show them all the railroads in
      the world, and they go in and git them, and then when they rub the salve
      on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with their
      railroads. Here&rsquo;s the treasure-hill now. Lower away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We landed, but it warn&rsquo;t as interesting as I thought it was going to be,
      because we couldn&rsquo;t find the place where they went in to git the treasure.
      Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere hill itself
      where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim said he wou&rsquo;dn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; missed it
      for three dollars, and I felt the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could come
      into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a little
      hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that was
      almost just like it, and nothing to help him but only his own learning and
      his own natural smartness. We talked and talked it over together, but
      couldn&rsquo;t make out how he done it. He had the best head on him I ever see;
      and all he lacked was age, to make a name for himself equal to Captain
      Kidd or George Washington. I bet you it would &rsquo;a&rsquo; crowded either of THEM
      to find that hill, with all their gifts, but it warn&rsquo;t nothing to Tom
      Sawyer; he went across Sahara and put his finger on it as easy as you
      could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt
      around the edges, and loaded up the lion&rsquo;s skin and the tiger&rsquo;s so as they
      would keep till Jim could tan them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE SAND-STORM
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then just as the full moon
      was touching the ground on the other side of the desert, we see a string
      of little black figgers moving across its big silver face. You could see
      them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink. It was another
      caravan. We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it, just to have
      company, though it warn&rsquo;t going our way. It was a rattler, that caravan,
      and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come
      a-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on
      the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses marching in
      procession. We never went very near it, because we knowed better now than
      to act like that and scare people&rsquo;s camels and break up their caravans. It
      was the gayest outfit you ever see, for rich clothes and nobby style. Some
      of the chiefs rode on dromedaries, the first we ever see, and very tall,
      and they go plunging along like they was on stilts, and they rock the man
      that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable, I bet
      you, but they make noble good time, and a camel ain&rsquo;t nowheres with them
      for speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and then started
      again about the middle of the afternoon. Before long the sun begun to look
      very curious. First it kind of turned to brass, and then to copper, and
      after that it begun to look like a blood-red ball, and the air got hot and
      close, and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and looked
      thick and foggy, but fiery and dreadful&mdash;like it looks through a
      piece of red glass, you know. We looked down and see a big confusion going
      on in the caravan, and a rushing every which way like they was scared; and
      then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid there perfectly
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide
      wall, and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun, and it
      was coming like the nation, too. Then a little faint breeze struck us, and
      then it come harder, and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces
      and sting like fire, and Tom sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sand-storm&mdash;turn your backs to it!&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0131}.jpg" alt="{0131}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0131}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We done it; and in another minute it was blowing a gale, and the sand beat
      against us by the shovelful, and the air was so thick with it we couldn&rsquo;t
      see a thing. In five minutes the boat was level full, and we was setting
      on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only our heads out and
      could hardly breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing off
      across the desert, awful to look at, I tell you. We dug ourselves out and
      looked down, and where the caravan was before there wasn&rsquo;t anything but
      just the sand ocean now, and all still and quiet. All them people and
      camels was smothered and dead and buried&mdash;buried under ten foot of
      sand, we reckoned, and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind
      uncovered them, and all that time their friends wouldn&rsquo;t ever know what
      become of that caravan. Tom said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOW we know what it was that happened to the people we got the swords and
      pistols from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sir, that was just it. It was as plain as day now. They got buried in
      a sand-storm, and the wild animals couldn&rsquo;t get at them, and the wind
      never uncovered them again until they was dried to leather and warn&rsquo;t fit
      to eat. It seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor people as a
      person could for anybody, and as mournful, too, but we was mistaken; this
      last caravan&rsquo;s death went harder with us, a good deal harder. You see, the
      others was total strangers, and we never got to feeling acquainted with
      them at all, except, maybe, a little with the man that was watching the
      girl, but it was different with this last caravan. We was huvvering around
      them a whole night and &rsquo;most a whole day, and had got to feeling real
      friendly with them, and acquainted. I have found out that there ain&rsquo;t no
      surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel
      with them. Just so with these. We kind of liked them from the start, and
      traveling with them put on the finisher. The longer we traveled with them,
      and the more we got used to their ways, the better and better we liked
      them, and the gladder and gladder we was that we run across them. We had
      come to know some of them so well that we called them by name when we was
      talking about them, and soon got so familiar and sociable that we even
      dropped the Miss and Mister and just used their plain names without any
      handle, and it did not seem unpolite, but just the right thing. Of course,
      it wasn&rsquo;t their own names, but names we give them. There was Mr. Elexander
      Robinson and Miss Adaline Robinson, and Colonel Jacob McDougal and Miss
      Harryet McDougal, and Judge Jeremiah Butler and young Bushrod Butler, and
      these was big chiefs mostly that wore splendid great turbans and
      simmeters, and dressed like the Grand Mogul, and their families. But as
      soon as we come to know them good, and like them very much, it warn&rsquo;t
      Mister, nor Judge, nor nothing, any more, but only Elleck, and Addy, and
      Jake, and Hattie, and Jerry, and Buck, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you know the more you join in with people in their joys and their
      sorrows, the more nearer and dearer they come to be to you. Now we warn&rsquo;t
      cold and indifferent, the way most travelers is, we was right down
      friendly and sociable, and took a chance in everything that was going, and
      the caravan could depend on us to be on hand every time, it didn&rsquo;t make no
      difference what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they camped, we camped right over them, ten or twelve hundred feet up
      in the air. When they et a meal, we et ourn, and it made it ever so much
      home-liker to have their company. When they had a wedding that night, and
      Buck and Addy got married, we got ourselves up in the very starchiest of
      the professor&rsquo;s duds for the blow-out, and when they danced we jined in
      and shook a foot up there.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0135}.jpg" alt="{0135}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0135}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      But it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest, and it was a
      funeral that done it with us. It was next morning, just in the still dawn.
      We didn&rsquo;t know the diseased, and he warn&rsquo;t in our set, but that never made
      no difference; he belonged to the caravan, and that was enough, and there
      warn&rsquo;t no more sincerer tears shed over him than the ones we dripped on
      him from up there eleven hundred foot on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to part
      with them others, which was comparative strangers, and been dead so long,
      anyway. We had knowed these in their lives, and was fond of them, too, and
      now to have death snatch them from right before our faces while we was
      looking, and leave us so lonesome and friendless in the middle of that big
      desert, it did hurt so, and we wished we mightn&rsquo;t ever make any more
      friends on that voyage if we was going to lose them again like that.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0139}.jpg" alt="{0139}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0139}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We couldn&rsquo;t keep from talking about them, and they was all the time coming
      up in our memory, and looking just the way they looked when we was all
      alive and happy together. We could see the line marching, and the shiny
      spearheads a-winking in the sun; we could see the dromedaries lumbering
      along; we could see the wedding and the funeral; and more oftener than
      anything else we could see them praying, because they don&rsquo;t allow nothing
      to prevent that; whenever the call come, several times a day, they would
      stop right there, and stand up and face to the east, and lift back their
      heads, and spread out their arms and begin, and four or five times they
      would go down on their knees, and then fall forward and touch their
      forehead to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it warn&rsquo;t good to go on talking about them, lovely as they was in
      their life, and dear to us in their life and death both, because it didn&rsquo;t
      do no good, and made us too down-hearted. Jim allowed he was going to live
      as good a life as he could, so he could see them again in a better world;
      and Tom kept still and didn&rsquo;t tell him they was only Mohammedans; it
      warn&rsquo;t no use to disappoint him, he was feeling bad enough just as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller, and had
      had a most powerful good sleep, because sand is the comfortablest bed
      there is, and I don&rsquo;t see why people that can afford it don&rsquo;t have it
      more. And it&rsquo;s terrible good ballast, too; I never see the balloon so
      steady before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom allowed we had twenty tons of it, and wondered what we better do with
      it; it was good sand, and it didn&rsquo;t seem good sense to throw it away. Jim
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, can&rsquo;t we tote it back home en sell it? How long&rsquo;ll it take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on the way we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sah, she&rsquo;s wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home, en I reckon
      we&rsquo;s got as much as twenty loads, hain&rsquo;t we? How much would dat be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jings, Mars Tom, le&rsquo;s shove for home right on de spot! Hit&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n a
      dollar en a half apiece, hain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ef dat ain&rsquo;t makin&rsquo; money de easiest ever I struck! She jes&rsquo; rained
      in&mdash;never cos&rsquo; us a lick o&rsquo; work. Le&rsquo;s mosey right along, Mars Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he never heard
      him. Pretty soon he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five dollars&mdash;sho! Look here, this sand&rsquo;s worth&mdash;worth&mdash;why,
      it&rsquo;s worth no end of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is dat, Mars Tom? Go on, honey, go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the minute people knows it&rsquo;s genuwyne sand from the genuwyne Desert
      of Sahara, they&rsquo;ll just be in a perfect state of mind to git hold of some
      of it to keep on the what-not in a vial with a label on it for a
      curiosity. All we got to do is to put it up in vials and float around all
      over the United States and peddle them out at ten cents apiece. We&rsquo;ve got
      all of ten thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of sand in this boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Me and Jim went all to pieces with joy, and begun to shout
      whoopjamboreehoo, and Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we can keep on coming back and fetching sand, and coming back and
      fetching more sand, and just keep it a-going till we&rsquo;ve carted this whole
      Desert over there and sold it out; and there ain&rsquo;t ever going to be any
      opposition, either, because we&rsquo;ll take out a patent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be as rich as Creosote, won&rsquo;t we, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Creesus, you mean. Why, that dervish was hunting in that little
      hill for the treasures of the earth, and didn&rsquo;t know he was walking over
      the real ones for a thousand miles. He was blinder than he made the
      driver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, how much is we gwyne to be worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know yet. It&rsquo;s got to be ciphered, and it ain&rsquo;t the easiest
      job to do, either, because it&rsquo;s over four million square miles of sand at
      ten cents a vial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim was awful excited, but this faded it out considerable, and he shook
      his head and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, we can&rsquo;t &rsquo;ford all dem vials&mdash;a king couldn&rsquo;t. We better
      not try to take de whole Desert, Mars Tom, de vials gwyne to bust us,
      sho&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s excitement died out, too, now, and I reckoned it was on account of
      the vials, but it wasn&rsquo;t. He set there thinking, and got bluer and bluer,
      and at last he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, it won&rsquo;t work; we got to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of the duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I couldn&rsquo;t make nothing out of that, neither could Jim. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS our duty, Tom? Because if we can&rsquo;t git around it, why can&rsquo;t we
      just DO it? People often has to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t that kind of duty. The kind I mean is a tax. Whenever you
      strike a frontier&mdash;that&rsquo;s the border of a country, you know&mdash;you
      find a custom-house there, and the gov&rsquo;ment officers comes and rummages
      among your things and charges a big tax, which they call a duty because
      it&rsquo;s their duty to bust you if they can, and if you don&rsquo;t pay the duty
      they&rsquo;ll hog your sand. They call it confiscating, but that don&rsquo;t deceive
      nobody, it&rsquo;s just hogging, and that&rsquo;s all it is. Now if we try to carry
      this sand home the way we&rsquo;re pointed now, we got to climb fences till we
      git tired&mdash;just frontier after frontier&mdash;Egypt, Arabia,
      Hindostan, and so on, and they&rsquo;ll all whack on a duty, and so you see,
      easy enough, we CAN&rsquo;T go THAT road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tom,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;we can sail right over their old frontiers; how are
      THEY going to stop us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked sorrowful at me, and says, very grave:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck Finn, do you think that would be honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hate them kind of interruptions. I never said nothing, and he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re shut off the other way, too. If we go back the way we&rsquo;ve
      come, there&rsquo;s the New York custom-house, and that is worse than all of
      them others put together, on account of the kind of cargo we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they can&rsquo;t raise Sahara sand in America, of course, and when they
      can&rsquo;t raise a thing there, the duty is fourteen hundred thousand per cent.
      on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no sense in that, Tom Sawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said there WAS? What do you talk to me like that for, Huck Finn? You
      wait till I say a thing&rsquo;s got sense in it before you go to accusing me of
      saying it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, consider me crying about it, and sorry. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, do dey jam dat duty onto everything we can&rsquo;t raise in America,
      en don&rsquo;t make no &rsquo;stinction &rsquo;twix&rsquo; anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, ain&rsquo;t de blessin&rsquo; o&rsquo; de Lord de mos&rsquo; valuable thing dey is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t de preacher stan&rsquo; up in de pulpit en call it down on de people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whah do it come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yassir! you&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; right, &rsquo;deed you is, honey&mdash;it come from heaven,
      en dat&rsquo;s a foreign country. NOW, den! do dey put a tax on dat blessin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course dey don&rsquo;t; en so it stan&rsquo; to reason dat you&rsquo;s mistaken, Mars Tom.
      Dey wouldn&rsquo;t put de tax on po&rsquo; truck like san&rsquo;, dat everybody ain&rsquo;t
      &rsquo;bleeged to have, en leave it off&rsquo;n de bes&rsquo; thing dey is, which nobody
      can&rsquo;t git along widout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Sawyer was stumped; he see Jim had got him where he couldn&rsquo;t budge. He
      tried to wiggle out by saying they had FORGOT to put on that tax, but
      they&rsquo;d be sure to remember about it, next session of Congress, and then
      they&rsquo;d put it on, but that was a poor lame come-off, and he knowed it. He
      said there warn&rsquo;t nothing foreign that warn&rsquo;t taxed but just that one, and
      so they couldn&rsquo;t be consistent without taxing it, and to be consistent was
      the first law of politics. So he stuck to it that they&rsquo;d left it out
      unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix it before they
      got caught and laughed at.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I didn&rsquo;t feel no more interest in such things, as long as we couldn&rsquo;t
      git our sand through, and it made me low-spirited, and Jim the same. Tom
      he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another speculation
      for us that would be just as good as this one and better, but it didn&rsquo;t do
      no good, we didn&rsquo;t believe there was any as big as this. It was mighty
      hard; such a little while ago we was so rich, and could &rsquo;a&rsquo; bought a
      country and started a kingdom and been celebrated and happy, and now we
      was so poor and ornery again, and had our sand left on our hands. The sand
      was looking so lovely before, just like gold and di&rsquo;monds, and the feel of
      it was so soft and so silky and nice, but now I couldn&rsquo;t bear the sight of
      it, it made me sick to look at it, and I knowed I wouldn&rsquo;t ever feel
      comfortable again till we got shut of it, and I didn&rsquo;t have it there no
      more to remind us of what we had been and what we had got degraded down
      to. The others was feeling the same way about it that I was. I knowed it,
      because they cheered up so, the minute I says le&rsquo;s throw this truck
      overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was going to be work, you know, and pretty solid work, too; so
      Tom he divided it up according to fairness and strength. He said me and
      him would clear out a fifth apiece of the sand, and Jim three-fifths. Jim
      he didn&rsquo;t quite like that arrangement. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I&rsquo;s de stronges&rsquo;, en I&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to do a share accordin&rsquo;, but by
      jings you&rsquo;s kinder pilin&rsquo; it onto ole Jim, Mars Tom, hain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t think so, Jim, but you try your hand at fixing it, and
      let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Jim reckoned it wouldn&rsquo;t be no more than fair if me and Tom done a
      TENTH apiece. Tom he turned his back to git room and be private, and then
      he smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara to the
      westward, back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from. Then he
      turned around again and said it was a good enough arrangement, and we was
      satisfied if Jim was. Jim said he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then Tom measured off our two-tenths in the bow and left the rest for
      Jim, and it surprised Jim a good deal to see how much difference there was
      and what a raging lot of sand his share come to, and said he was powerful
      glad now that he had spoke up in time and got the first arrangement
      altered, for he said that even the way it was now, there was more sand
      than enjoyment in his end of the contract, he believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we laid into it. It was mighty hot work, and tough; so hot we had to
      move up into cooler weather or we couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; stood it. Me and Tom took
      turn about, and one worked while t&rsquo;other rested, but there warn&rsquo;t nobody
      to spell poor old Jim, and he made all that part of Africa damp, he
      sweated so. We couldn&rsquo;t work good, we was so full of laugh, and Jim he
      kept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so, and we had to keep
      making up things to account for it, and they was pretty poor inventions,
      but they done well enough, Jim didn&rsquo;t see through them. At last when we
      got done we was &rsquo;most dead, but not with work but with laughing. By and by
      Jim was &rsquo;most dead, too, but: it was with work; then we took turns and
      spelled him, and he was as thankfull as he could be, and would set on the
      gunnel and swab the sweat, and heave and pant, and say how good we was to
      a poor old nigger, and he wouldn&rsquo;t ever forgit us. He was always the
      gratefulest nigger I ever see, for any little thing you done for him. He
      was only nigger outside; inside he was as white as you be.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. JIM STANDING SIEGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE next few meals was pretty sandy, but that don&rsquo;t make no difference
      when you are hungry; and when you ain&rsquo;t it ain&rsquo;t no satisfaction to eat,
      anyway, and so a little grit in the meat ain&rsquo;t no particular drawback, as
      far as I can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we struck the east end of the Desert at last, sailing on a northeast
      course. Away off on the edge of the sand, in a soft pinky light, we see
      three little sharp roofs like tents, and Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pyramids of Egypt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It made my heart fairly jump. You see, I had seen a many and a many a
      picture of them, and heard tell about them a hundred times, and yet to
      come on them all of a sudden, that way, and find they was REAL, &rsquo;stead of
      imaginations, &rsquo;most knocked the breath out of me with surprise. It&rsquo;s a
      curious thing, that the more you hear about a grand and big and bully
      thing or person, the more it kind of dreamies out, as you may say, and
      gets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moonshine and nothing solid
      to it. It&rsquo;s just so with George Washington, and the same with them
      pyramids.
    </p>
    <p>
      And moreover, besides, the thing they always said about them seemed to me
      to be stretchers. There was a feller come to the Sunday-school once, and
      had a picture of them, and made a speech, and said the biggest pyramid
      covered thirteen acres, and was most five hundred foot high, just a steep
      mountain, all built out of hunks of stone as big as a bureau, and laid up
      in perfectly regular layers, like stair-steps. Thirteen acres, you see,
      for just one building; it&rsquo;s a farm. If it hadn&rsquo;t been in Sunday-school, I
      would &rsquo;a&rsquo; judged it was a lie; and outside I was certain of it. And he
      said there was a hole in the pyramid, and you could go in there with
      candles, and go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel, and come to a large
      room in the stomach of that stone mountain, and there you would find a big
      stone chest with a king in it, four thousand years old. I said to myself,
      then, if that ain&rsquo;t a lie I will eat that king if they will fetch him, for
      even Methusalem warn&rsquo;t that old, and nobody claims it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in a long
      straight edge like a blanket, and on to it was joined, edge to edge, a
      wide country of bright green, with a snaky stripe crooking through it, and
      Tom said it was the Nile. It made my heart jump again, for the Nile was
      another thing that wasn&rsquo;t real to me. Now I can tell you one thing which
      is dead certain: if you will fool along over three thousand miles of
      yaller sand, all glimmering with heat so that it makes your eyes water to
      look at it, and you&rsquo;ve been a considerable part of a week doing it, the
      green country will look so like home and heaven to you that it will make
      your eyes water AGAIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just so with me, and the same with Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Jim got so he could believe it WAS the land of Egypt he was
      looking at, he wouldn&rsquo;t enter it standing up, but got down on his knees
      and took off his hat, because he said it wasn&rsquo;t fitten&rsquo; for a humble poor
      nigger to come any other way where such men had been as Moses and Joseph
      and Pharaoh and the other prophets. He was a Presbyterian, and had a most
      deep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian, too, he said. He was all
      stirred up, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s de lan&rsquo; of Egypt, de lan&rsquo; of Egypt, en I&rsquo;s &rsquo;lowed to look at it wid
      my own eyes! En dah&rsquo;s de river dat was turn&rsquo; to blood, en I&rsquo;s looking at
      de very same groun&rsquo; whah de plagues was, en de lice, en de frogs, en de
      locus&rsquo;, en de hail, en whah dey marked de door-pos&rsquo;, en de angel o&rsquo; de
      Lord come by in de darkness o&rsquo; de night en slew de fust-born in all de
      lan&rsquo; o&rsquo; Egypt. Ole Jim ain&rsquo;t worthy to see dis day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he just broke down and cried, he was so thankful. So between him
      and Tom there was talk enough, Jim being excited because the land was so
      full of history&mdash;Joseph and his brethren, Moses in the bulrushers,
      Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy corn, the silver cup in the sack, and
      all them interesting things; and Tom just as excited too, because the land
      was so full of history that was in HIS line, about Noureddin, and
      Bedreddin, and such like monstrous giants, that made Jim&rsquo;s wool rise, and
      a raft of other Arabian Nights folks, which the half of them never done
      the things they let on they done, I don&rsquo;t believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we struck a disappointment, for one of them early morning fogs
      started up, and it warn&rsquo;t no use to sail over the top of it, because we
      would go by Egypt, sure, so we judged it was best to set her by compass
      straight for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and blotted
      out, and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the ground and keep
      a sharp lookout. Tom took the hellum, I stood by to let go the anchor, and
      Jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with his eyes and watch
      out for danger ahead. We went along a steady gait, but not very fast, and
      the fog got solider and solider, so solid that Jim looked dim and ragged
      and smoky through it. It was awful still, and we talked low and was
      anxious. Now and then Jim would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highst her a p&rsquo;int, Mars Tom, highst her!&rdquo; and up she would skip, a foot
      or two, and we would slide right over a flat-roofed mud cabin, with people
      that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and gap and stretch;
      and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs so he could gap and
      stretch better, we took him a blip in the back and knocked him off. By and
      by, after about an hour, and everything dead still and we a-straining our
      ears for sounds and holding our breath, the fog thinned a little, very
      sudden, and Jim sung out in an awful scare:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for de lan&rsquo;s sake, set her back, Mars Tom, here&rsquo;s de biggest giant
      outen de &rsquo;Rabian Nights a-comin&rsquo; for us!&rdquo; and he went over backwards in
      the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom slammed on the back-action, and as we slowed to a standstill a man&rsquo;s
      face as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel, same as a
      house looks out of its windows, and I laid down and died. I must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been
      clear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more; then I come to, and
      Tom had hitched a boat-hook on to the lower lip of the giant and was
      holding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head back and got
      a good long look up at that awful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim was on his knees with his hands clasped, gazing up at the thing in a
      begging way, and working his lips, but not getting anything out. I took
      only just a glimpse, and was fading out again, but Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t alive, you fools; it&rsquo;s the Sphinx!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never see Tom look so little and like a fly; but that was because the
      giant&rsquo;s head was so big and awful. Awful, yes, so it was, but not dreadful
      any more, because you could see it was a noble face, and kind of sad, and
      not thinking about you, but about other things and larger. It was stone,
      reddish stone, and its nose and ears battered, and that give it an abused
      look, and you felt sorrier for it for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood off a piece, and sailed around it and over it, and it was just
      grand. It was a man&rsquo;s head, or maybe a woman&rsquo;s, on a tiger&rsquo;s body a
      hundred and twenty-five foot long, and there was a dear little temple
      between its front paws. All but the head used to be under the sand, for
      hundreds of years, maybe thousands, but they had just lately dug the sand
      away and found that little temple. It took a power of sand to bury that
      cretur; most as much as it would to bury a steamboat, I reckon.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0151}.jpg" alt="{0151}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0151}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We landed Jim on top of the head, with an American flag to protect him, it
      being a foreign land; then we sailed off to this and that and t&rsquo;other
      distance, to git what Tom called effects and perspectives and proportions,
      and Jim he done the best he could, striking all the different kinds of
      attitudes and positions he could study up, but standing on his head and
      working his legs the way a frog does was the best. The further we got
      away, the littler Jim got, and the grander the Sphinx got, till at last it
      was only a clothespin on a dome, as you might say. That&rsquo;s the way
      perspective brings out the correct proportions, Tom said; he said Julus
      Cesar&rsquo;s niggers didn&rsquo;t know how big he was, they was too close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we sailed off further and further, till we couldn&rsquo;t see Jim at all
      any more, and then that great figger was at its noblest, a-gazing out over
      the Nile Valley so still and solemn and lonesome, and all the little
      shabby huts and things that was scattered about it clean disappeared and
      gone, and nothing around it now but a soft wide spread of yaller velvet,
      which was the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the right place to stop, and we done it. We set there a-looking
      and a-thinking for a half an hour, nobody a-saying anything, for it made
      us feel quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been looking over that
      valley just that same way, and thinking its awful thoughts all to itself
      for thousands of years, and nobody can&rsquo;t find out what they are to this
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I took up the glass and see some little black things a-capering
      around on that velvet carpet, and some more a-climbing up the cretur&rsquo;s
      back, and then I see two or three wee puffs of white smoke, and told Tom
      to look. He done it, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re bugs. No&mdash;hold on; they&mdash;why, I believe they&rsquo;re men.
      Yes, it&rsquo;s men&mdash;men and horses both. They&rsquo;re hauling a long ladder up
      onto the Sphinx&rsquo;s back&mdash;now ain&rsquo;t that odd? And now they&rsquo;re trying to
      lean it up a&mdash;there&rsquo;s some more puffs of smoke&mdash;it&rsquo;s guns! Huck,
      they&rsquo;re after Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0155}.jpg" alt="{0155}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0155}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We clapped on the power, and went for them a-biling. We was there in no
      time, and come a-whizzing down amongst them, and they broke and scattered
      every which way, and some that was climbing the ladder after Jim let go
      all holts and fell. We soared up and found him laying on top of the head
      panting and most tuckered out, partly from howling for help and partly
      from scare. He had been standing a siege a long time&mdash;a week, HE
      said, but it warn&rsquo;t so, it only just seemed so to him because they was
      crowding him so. They had shot at him, and rained the bullets all around
      him, but he warn&rsquo;t hit, and when they found he wouldn&rsquo;t stand up and the
      bullets couldn&rsquo;t git at him when he was laying down, they went for the
      ladder, and then he knowed it was all up with him if we didn&rsquo;t come pretty
      quick. Tom was very indignant, and asked him why he didn&rsquo;t show the flag
      and command them to GIT, in the name of the United States. Jim said he
      done it, but they never paid no attention. Tom said he would have this
      thing looked into at Washington, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;ll have to apologize for insulting the flag, and pay
      an indemnity, too, on top of it even if they git off THAT easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an indemnity, Mars Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cash, that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gits it, Mars Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, WE do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;En who gits de apology?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The United States. Or, we can take whichever we please. We can take the
      apology, if we want to, and let the gov&rsquo;ment take the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money will it be, Mars Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in an aggravated case like this one, it will be at least three
      dollars apiece, and I don&rsquo;t know but more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, den, we&rsquo;ll take de money, Mars Tom, blame de &rsquo;pology. Hain&rsquo;t dat
      yo&rsquo; notion, too? En hain&rsquo;t it yourn, Huck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way as any,
      so we agreed to take the money. It was a new business to me, and I asked
      Tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the little ones does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We was sailing around examining the pyramids, you know, and now we soared
      up and roosted on the flat top of the biggest one, and found it was just
      like what the man said in the Sunday-school. It was like four pairs of
      stairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up and comes together in
      a point at the top, only these stair-steps couldn&rsquo;t be clumb the way you
      climb other stairs; no, for each step was as high as your chin, and you
      have to be boosted up from behind. The two other pyramids warn&rsquo;t far away,
      and the people moving about on the sand between looked like bugs crawling,
      we was so high above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom he couldn&rsquo;t hold himself he was so worked up with gladness and
      astonishment to be in such a celebrated place, and he just dripped history
      from every pore, seemed to me. He said he couldn&rsquo;t scarcely believe he was
      standing on the very identical spot the prince flew from on the Bronze
      Horse. It was in the Arabian Night times, he said. Somebody give the
      prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder, and he could git on him
      and fly through the air like a bird, and go all over the world, and steer
      it by turning the peg, and fly high or low and land wherever he wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable silences
      that comes, you know, when a person has been telling a whopper and you
      feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to change the
      subject and let him down easy, but git stuck and don&rsquo;t see no way, and
      before you can pull your mind together and DO something, that silence has
      got in and spread itself and done the business. I was embarrassed, Jim he
      was embarrassed, and neither of us couldn&rsquo;t say a word. Well, Tom he
      glowered at me a minute, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, out with it. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, YOU don&rsquo;t believe that, yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason I don&rsquo;t? What&rsquo;s to hender me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing to hender you: it couldn&rsquo;t happen, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason it couldn&rsquo;t happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me the reason it COULD happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This balloon is a good enough reason it could happen, I should reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHY is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHY is it? I never saw such an idiot. Ain&rsquo;t this balloon and the bronze
      horse the same thing under different names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not. One is a balloon and the other&rsquo;s a horse. It&rsquo;s very
      different. Next you&rsquo;ll be saying a house and a cow is the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jackson, Huck&rsquo;s got him ag&rsquo;in! Dey ain&rsquo;t no wigglin&rsquo; outer dat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your head, Jim; you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. And Huck
      don&rsquo;t. Look here, Huck, I&rsquo;ll make it plain to you, so you can understand.
      You see, it ain&rsquo;t the mere FORM that&rsquo;s got anything to do with their being
      similar or unsimilar, it&rsquo;s the PRINCIPLE involved; and the principle is
      the same in both. Don&rsquo;t you see, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned it over in my mind, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, it ain&rsquo;t no use. Principles is all very well, but they don&rsquo;t git
      around that one big fact, that the thing that a balloon can do ain&rsquo;t no
      sort of proof of what a horse can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, Huck, you don&rsquo;t get the idea at all. Now look here a minute&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      perfectly plain. Don&rsquo;t we fly through the air?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Don&rsquo;t we fly high or fly low, just as we please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we steer whichever way we want to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t we land when and where we please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do we move the balloon and steer it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By touching the buttons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOW I reckon the thing is clear to you at last. In the other case the
      moving and steering was done by turning a peg. We touch a button, the
      prince turned a peg. There ain&rsquo;t an atom of difference, you see. I knowed
      I could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt so happy he begun to whistle. But me and Jim was silent, so he
      broke off surprised, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here, Huck Finn, don&rsquo;t you see it YET?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, I want to ask you some questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he says, and I see Jim chirk up to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I understand it, the whole thing is in the buttons and the peg&mdash;the
      rest ain&rsquo;t of no consequence. A button is one shape, a peg is another
      shape, but that ain&rsquo;t any matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that ain&rsquo;t any matter, as long as they&rsquo;ve both got the same power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. What is the power that&rsquo;s in a candle and in a match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same in both, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just the same in both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop with a match, what will
      happen to that carpenter shop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll burn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a candle&mdash;will she burn
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Now the fire&rsquo;s the same, both times. WHY does the shop burn,
      and the pyramid don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the pyramid CAN&rsquo;T burn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! and A HORSE CAN&rsquo;T FLY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lan&rsquo;, ef Huck ain&rsquo;t got him ag&rsquo;in! Huck&rsquo;s landed him high en dry dis
      time, I tell you! Hit&rsquo;s de smartes&rsquo; trap I ever see a body walk inter&mdash;en
      ef I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldn&rsquo;t go on, and
      Tom was that mad to see how neat I had floored him, and turned his own
      argument ag&rsquo;in him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it, that
      all he could manage to say was that whenever he heard me and Jim try to
      argue it made him ashamed of the human race. I never said nothing; I was
      feeling pretty well satisfied. When I have got the best of a person that
      way, it ain&rsquo;t my way to go around crowing about it the way some people
      does, for I consider that if I was in his place I wouldn&rsquo;t wish him to
      crow over me. It&rsquo;s better to be generous, that&rsquo;s what I think.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. GOING FOR TOM&rsquo;S PIPE:
    </h2>
    <p>
      BY AND BY we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of the
      pyramids, and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the tunnel, and
      went in with some Arabs and candles, and away in there in the middle of
      the pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it where they used to
      keep that king, just as the man in the Sunday-school said; but he was
      gone, now; somebody had got him. But I didn&rsquo;t take no interest in the
      place, because there could be ghosts there, of course; not fresh ones, but
      I don&rsquo;t like no kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece, and then
      went in a boat another piece, and then more donkeys, and got to Cairo; and
      all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as ever I see, and
      had tall date-pa&rsquo;ms on both sides, and naked children everywhere, and the
      men was as red as copper, and fine and strong and handsome. And the city
      was a curiosity. Such narrow streets&mdash;why, they were just lanes, and
      crowded with people with turbans, and women with veils, and everybody
      rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sorts of colors, and you
      wondered how the camels and the people got by each other in such narrow
      little cracks, but they done it&mdash;a perfect jam, you see, and
      everybody noisy. The stores warn&rsquo;t big enough to turn around in, but you
      didn&rsquo;t have to go in; the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on his counter,
      smoking his snaky long pipe, and had his things where he could reach them
      to sell, and he was just as good as in the street, for the camel-loads
      brushed him as they went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed men
      running and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long rod
      that didn&rsquo;t get out of the way. And by and by along comes the Sultan
      riding horseback at the head of a procession, and fairly took your breath
      away his clothes was so splendid; and everybody fell flat and laid on his
      stomach while he went by. I forgot, but a feller helped me to remember. He
      was one that had a rod and run in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was churches, but they don&rsquo;t know enough to keep Sunday; they keep
      Friday and break the Sabbath. You have to take off your shoes when you go
      in. There was crowds of men and boys in the church, setting in groups on
      the stone floor and making no end of noise&mdash;getting their lessons by
      heart, Tom said, out of the Koran, which they think is a Bible, and people
      that knows better knows enough to not let on. I never see such a big
      church in my life before, and most awful high, it was; it made you dizzy
      to look up; our village church at home ain&rsquo;t a circumstance to it; if you
      was to put it in there, people would think it was a drygoods box.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was interested in dervishes
      on accounts of the one that played the trick on the camel-driver. So we
      found a lot in a kind of a church, and they called themselves Whirling
      Dervishes; and they did whirl, too. I never see anything like it. They had
      tall sugar-loaf hats on, and linen petticoats; and they spun and spun and
      spun, round and round like tops, and the petticoats stood out on a slant,
      and it was the prettiest thing I ever see, and made me drunk to look at
      it. They was all Moslems, Tom said, and when I asked him what a Moslem
      was, he said it was a person that wasn&rsquo;t a Presbyterian. So there is
      plenty of them in Missouri, though I didn&rsquo;t know it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn&rsquo;t see half there was to see in Cairo, because Tom was in such a
      sweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history. We had a most
      tiresome time to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain before
      the famine, and when we found it it warn&rsquo;t worth much to look at, being
      such an old tumble-down wreck; but Tom was satisfied, and made more fuss
      over it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot. How he ever found
      that place was too many for me. We passed as much as forty just like it
      before we come to it, and any of them would &rsquo;a&rsquo; done for me, but none but
      just the right one would suit him; I never see anybody so particular as
      Tom Sawyer. The minute he struck the right one he reconnized it as easy as
      I would reconnize my other shirt if I had one, but how he done it he
      couldn&rsquo;t any more tell than he could fly; he said so himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that learned
      the cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones, and said
      it was out of the Arabian Nights, and he would tell me and Jim about it
      when he got time. Well, we hunted and hunted till I was ready to drop, and
      I wanted Tom to give it up and come next day and git somebody that knowed
      the town and could talk Missourian and could go straight to the place; but
      no, he wanted to find it himself, and nothing else would answer. So on we
      went. Then at last the remarkablest thing happened I ever see. The house
      was gone&mdash;gone hundreds of years ago&mdash;every last rag of it gone
      but just one mud brick. Now a person wouldn&rsquo;t ever believe that a
      backwoods Missouri boy that hadn&rsquo;t ever been in that town before could go
      and hunt that place over and find that brick, but Tom Sawyer done it. I
      know he done it, because I see him do it. I was right by his very side at
      the time, and see him see the brick and see him reconnize it. Well, I says
      to myself, how DOES he do it? Is it knowledge, or is it instink?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there&rsquo;s the facts, just as they happened: let everybody explain it
      their own way. I&rsquo;ve ciphered over it a good deal, and it&rsquo;s my opinion that
      some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink. The reason is
      this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with his name on
      it and the facts when he went home, and I slipped it out and put another
      brick considerable like it in its place, and he didn&rsquo;t know the difference&mdash;but
      there was a difference, you see. I think that settles it&mdash;it&rsquo;s mostly
      instink, not knowledge. Instink tells him where the exact PLACE is for the
      brick to be in, and so he reconnizes it by the place it&rsquo;s in, not by the
      look of the brick. If it was knowledge, not instink, he would know the
      brick again by the look of it the next time he seen it&mdash;which he
      didn&rsquo;t. So it shows that for all the brag you hear about knowledge being
      such a wonderful thing, instink is worth forty of it for real
      unerringness. Jim says the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got back Jim dropped down and took us in, and there was a young
      man there with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket
      and baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it that
      could talk English and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to Mecca
      and Medina and Central Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar a day
      and his keep, and we hired him and left, and piled on the power, and by
      the time we was through dinner we was over the place where the Israelites
      crossed the Red Sea when Pharaoh tried to overtake them and was caught by
      the waters. We stopped, then, and had a good look at the place, and it
      done Jim good to see it. He said he could see it all, now, just the way it
      happened; he could see the Israelites walking along between the walls of
      water, and the Egyptians coming, from away off yonder, hurrying all they
      could, and see them start in as the Israelites went out, and then when
      they was all in, see the walls tumble together and drown the last man of
      them. Then we piled on the power again and rushed away and huvvered over
      Mount Sinai, and saw the place where Moses broke the tables of stone, and
      where the children of Israel camped in the plain and worshiped the golden
      calf, and it was all just as interesting as could be, and the guide knowed
      every place as well as I knowed the village at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we had an accident, now, and it fetched all the plans to a standstill.
      Tom&rsquo;s old ornery corn-cob pipe had got so old and swelled and warped that
      she couldn&rsquo;t hold together any longer, notwithstanding the strings and
      bandages, but caved in and went to pieces. Tom he didn&rsquo;t know WHAT to do.
      The professor&rsquo;s pipe wouldn&rsquo;t answer; it warn&rsquo;t anything but a mershum,
      and a person that&rsquo;s got used to a cob pipe knows it lays a long ways over
      all the other pipes in this world, and you can&rsquo;t git him to smoke any
      other. He wouldn&rsquo;t take mine, I couldn&rsquo;t persuade him. So there he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it over, and said we must scour around and see if we could
      roust out one in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries, but
      the guide said no, it warn&rsquo;t no use, they didn&rsquo;t have them. So Tom was
      pretty glum for a little while, then he chirked up and said he&rsquo;d got the
      idea and knowed what to do. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another corn-cob pipe, and it&rsquo;s a prime one, too, and nearly
      new. It&rsquo;s laying on the rafter that&rsquo;s right over the kitchen stove at home
      in the village. Jim, you and the guide will go and get it, and me and Huck
      will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mars Tom, we couldn&rsquo;t ever find de village. I could find de pipe,
      &rsquo;case I knows de kitchen, but my lan&rsquo;, we can&rsquo;t ever find de village, nur
      Sent Louis, nur none o&rsquo; dem places. We don&rsquo;t know de way, Mars Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a fact, and it stumped Tom for a minute. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here, it can be done, sure; and I&rsquo;ll tell you how. You set your
      compass and sail west as straight as a dart, till you find the United
      States. It ain&rsquo;t any trouble, because it&rsquo;s the first land you&rsquo;ll strike
      the other side of the Atlantic. If it&rsquo;s daytime when you strike it, bulge
      right on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast, and in
      an hour and three quarters you&rsquo;ll hit the mouth of the Mississippi&mdash;at
      the speed that I&rsquo;m going to send you. You&rsquo;ll be so high up in the air that
      the earth will be curved considerable&mdash;sorter like a washbowl turned
      upside down&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll see a raft of rivers crawling around every
      which way, long before you get there, and you can pick out the Mississippi
      without any trouble. Then you can follow the river north nearly, an hour
      and three quarters, till you see the Ohio come in; then you want to look
      sharp, because you&rsquo;re getting near. Away up to your left you&rsquo;ll see
      another thread coming in&mdash;that&rsquo;s the Missouri and is a little above
      St. Louis. You&rsquo;ll come down low then, so as you can examine the villages
      as you spin along. You&rsquo;ll pass about twenty-five in the next fifteen
      minutes, and you&rsquo;ll recognize ours when you see it&mdash;and if you don&rsquo;t,
      you can yell down and ask.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0167}.jpg" alt="{0167}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0167}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef it&rsquo;s dat easy, Mars Tom, I reckon we kin do it&mdash;yassir, I knows
      we kin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guide was sure of it, too, and thought that he could learn to stand
      his watch in a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;This
      balloon&rsquo;s as easy to manage as a canoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go back west is the shortest way, you see. It&rsquo;s only about seven
      thousand miles. If you went east, and so on around, it&rsquo;s over twice as
      far.&rdquo; Then he says to the guide, &ldquo;I want you both to watch the tell-tale
      all through the watches, and whenever it don&rsquo;t mark three hundred miles an
      hour, you go higher or drop lower till you find a storm-current that&rsquo;s
      going your way. There&rsquo;s a hundred miles an hour in this old thing without
      any wind to help. There&rsquo;s two-hundred-mile gales to be found, any time you
      want to hunt for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hunt for them, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that you do. Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles, and
      it&rsquo;ll be p&rsquo;ison cold, but most of the time you&rsquo;ll find your storm a good
      deal lower. If you can only strike a cyclone&mdash;that&rsquo;s the ticket for
      you! You&rsquo;ll see by the professor&rsquo;s books that they travel west in these
      latitudes; and they travel low, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he ciphered on the time, and says&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven thousand miles, three hundred miles an hour&mdash;you can make the
      trip in a day&mdash;twenty-four hours. This is Thursday; you&rsquo;ll be back
      here Saturday afternoon. Come, now, hustle out some blankets and food and
      books and things for me and Huck, and you can start right along. There
      ain&rsquo;t no occasion to fool around&mdash;I want a smoke, and the quicker you
      fetch that pipe the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All hands jumped for the things, and in eight minutes our things was out
      and the balloon was ready for America. So we shook hands good-bye, and Tom
      gave his last orders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 10 minutes to 2 P.M. now, Mount Sinai time. In 24 hours you&rsquo;ll be
      home, and it&rsquo;ll be 6 to-morrow morning, village time. When you strike the
      village, land a little back of the top of the hill, in the woods, out of
      sight; then you rush down, Jim, and shove these letters in the
      post-office, and if you see anybody stirring, pull your slouch down over
      your face so they won&rsquo;t know you. Then you go and slip in the back way to
      the kitchen and git the pipe, and lay this piece of paper on the kitchen
      table, and put something on it to hold it, and then slide out and git
      away, and don&rsquo;t let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody else. Then
      you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three hundred miles an
      hour. You won&rsquo;t have lost more than an hour. You&rsquo;ll start back at 7 or 8
      A.M., village time, and be here in 24 hours, arriving at 2 or 3 P.M.,
      Mount Sinai time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom he read the piece of paper to us. He had wrote on it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;THURSDAY AFTERNOON. Tom Sawyer the Erro-nort
     sends his love to Aunt Polly from Mount Sinai
     where the Ark was, and so does Huck Finn, and she
     will get it to-morrow morning half-past six.&rdquo; *

  [* This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck&rsquo;s   error, not
     Tom&rsquo;s.&mdash;M.T.]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come,&rdquo; he says. Then he
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by! One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;away you go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And away she DID go! Why, she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole big
      plain, and there we camped to wait for the pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balloon come back all right, and brung the pipe; but Aunt Polly had
      catched Jim when he was getting it, and anybody can guess what happened:
      she sent for Tom. So Jim he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mars Tom, she&rsquo;s out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky a-layin&rsquo; for
      you, en she say she ain&rsquo;t gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold of
      you. Dey&rsquo;s gwyne to be trouble, Mars Tom, &rsquo;deed dey is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So then we shoved for home, and not feeling very gay, neither.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
